Based on the provided job descriptions and your specific background in materials engineering, electron microscopy for microstructural characterization, and establishing structure-property relationships, all 16 job opportunities have been filtered out due to one or more of the following reasons:
1.  **Irrelevant Field**: The job is in a field completely unrelated to materials engineering or electron microscopy (e.g., humanities, business, psychology, medicine, public health, computer science, molecular biology, advertising).
2.  **Not Tenure-Track**: The position is explicitly stated as non-tenure track, fixed-term, faculty associate, or postdoctoral fellow.
3.  **Not R1 University**: The institution is not classified as a "Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity (R1)" by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.
4.  **Low Relevance/Administrative Focus**: While some jobs might broadly mention "energy" or "environment," their core focus (e.g., community-engaged research, administrative director role) does not align with your specialized technical expertise in materials characterization via electron microscopy for a research-focused teaching faculty position.
5.  **Not in North America**: One job was identified as being in Taiwan, not North America.

As a result, no jobs meet all the specified criteria for summarization.
