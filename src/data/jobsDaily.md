All 20 job opportunities have been reviewed against your criteria. Based on the specified filtering rules (relevance to Materials Engineering/electron microscopy, tenure-track status, and R1 institution classification), none of the provided jobs meet all the requirements. Therefore, no summaries will be generated.
All the provided job opportunities were filtered out based on the specified criteria:
1.  **Irrelevant Field**: Many jobs were in fields such as Management, Entrepreneurship, Philosophy, Journalism, Education, Architecture, Economics, or Product Design, which are not directly related to Materials Engineering or electron microscopy for materials characterization.
2.  **Not Tenure-Track**: Some positions were explicitly listed as "teaching-track faculty" or "non-tenure track positions".
3.  **Not R1 Institution**: Several universities were identified as R2 (Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity), M1 (Master's Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs), or Baccalaureate Colleges, rather than R1 (Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity) as required.

Therefore, no jobs remain to be summarized.
