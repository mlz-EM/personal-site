All provided job opportunities were carefully reviewed based on your criteria. Most positions were filtered out due to being in completely unrelated fields (e.g., humanities, medical, biology, library science), not being tenure-track, or being for administrative roles for existing tenured faculty.

As per your instruction to retain the two most relevant jobs if all are largely irrelevant, I have selected the following two. Please note that even these two are not directly aligned with your expertise in electron microscopy for materials characterization, but they represent the closest matches in terms of being tenure-track academic positions in scientific/engineering-adjacent fields, or having a very loose connection to "instrumental analysis."
