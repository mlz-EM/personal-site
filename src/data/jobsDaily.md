Based on your background in Materials Engineering and electron microscopy, and after applying the strict filters (R1 institution, Tenure-Track position, relevant engineering/science field, and non-management/non-liberal arts roles), none of the 20 provided job opportunities (Job 61 to Job 80) match your criteria.

Most of the jobs were filtered out for the following reasons:
- **Non-R1 Institutions**: Missouri State University, Bluffton University, Valdosta State University, Clayton State University, University of North Dakota, McMurry University, and Elizabethtown College.
- **Irrelevant Fields**: Finance, Music, Education, Accounting, Fashion Design, Life Sciences Communication, Nutrition, and Actuarial Science.
- **Non-Tenure Track**: Several positions at Virginia Tech and UND were "Professor of Practice" or "Instructor" roles, which are explicitly non-tenure track.
- **Management/Seniority**: The Department Head position at Virginia Tech is an administrative/management role and requires seniority (Full Professor) beyond a recent PhD graduate's level.
- **Specific Cluster Focus**: The AI cluster at UT Arlington is focused on Computer Science/Strong AI theory and Biomedical Engineering, which does not align with your core expertise in micro-scale material characterization.

Therefore, there are no job summaries to display for this batch.
Based on your background in Materials Engineering (electron microscopy, structure-property relationships) and the criteria provided (R1 institutions, tenure-track positions, and relevant fields), all 20 jobs provided have been filtered out for the following reasons:

1.  **Job 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 88, 89, 90, 91, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99**: These institutions (Arkansas Tech, UVA Wise, Chattanooga State, Middle Georgia State, UN Omaha, Lamar, UNT Dallas, Alcorn State, UCO, SIU Carbondale, and USD) are not classified as R1 research institutions.
2.  **Job 82, 87, 96**: While these are R1 institutions (UT Dallas, University of Iowa, Virginia Tech), the fields (Animation/Emergent Media, Music/Horn, and Geospatial Information Technology/National Security) are completely unrelated to Materials Engineering.
3.  **Job 92, 93, 100**: These positions are within Medical Schools (FIU, UW, Pitt) and focus on clinical/translational medicine (Stroke, Anesthesiology, Gastroenterology), which are excluded per your instructions. Additionally, Job 93 is specifically listed as a non-tenure track position.

As no jobs from the provided list meet your specific requirements, no summaries have been generated.

Based on the criteria provided (Tenure-Track, R1 University status, and relevance to Materials Engineering and Micro-scale Characterization), none of the 20 job opportunities (Job 121 to Job 140) met the requirements for inclusion.

Below is a brief summary of why the provided jobs were excluded:

1.  **Field Irrelevance**: The majority of the listings were in fields completely unrelated to Materials Engineering, such as Educational Foundations (Job 121), Finance (Jobs 128, 130), Management (Job 129), Music (Job 135), and Art History (Job 137).
2.  **Non-Tenure Track (NTT)**: Several positions were explicitly identified as non-tenure track, including the Extension roles at West Virginia University (Job 124) and the University of Georgia (Jobs 134, 136), as well as the Research Professor role at UTEP (Job 138) and the Teaching Faculty role at Drexel (Job 140).
3.  **Non-R1 Status**: Many of the schools provided are not classified as R1 Research Universities (e.g., Keene State College, Antelope Valley College, Bethel University, CUNY Hunter College, SUNY Plattsburgh, and Barnard College).
4.  **Medical School/Management**: Job 126 (University of Florida) was a tenure-track role but was excluded as it is located within the Department of Neurosurgery (Medical School).

Because no jobs remained after applying your filters, no Markdown summaries have been generated.
