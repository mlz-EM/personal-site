Based on the 20 job opportunities provided and your specific criteria (Materials Engineering background, electron microscopy/characterization focus, Tenure-Track, and R1 University status), none of the listed positions meet all the requirements.

Below is a summary of why the provided jobs were excluded:

1.  **Unrelated Fields**: Most positions were in fields such as Education (Job 1), African American Studies (Jobs 2, 8), Creative Writing (Job 5), Psychology (Jobs 6, 18), Music (Job 7), Aviation (Job 9), Finance (Job 10), Physical Education (Job 11), Political Science (Job 12), Marketing (Job 13), Writing (Job 14), Pediatrics (Job 15), Special Education (Job 17), Business (Job 19), and Real Estate (Job 20).
2.  **Non-Tenure Track**: Several roles were explicitly non-tenure track, including Instructor/Teaching Faculty (Jobs 7, 12, 20), Postdoctoral Fellows (Jobs 2, 8), Professor of Practice (Job 10), Faculty Associates (Jobs 14, 16), and Clinician-Educators (Job 15).
3.  **Non-R1 Institutions**: Many schools listed are classified as R2 (High Research Activity), Master's Colleges, or Liberal Arts Colleges rather than R1 (Very High Research Activity). This includes Northern State University, Sweet Briar College, Columbia College, Missouri State University, University of Minnesota Duluth, Western Michigan University, Georgia Southwestern State University, Eastern Kentucky University, Texas A&M Victoria, Mayville State University, and Montclair State University.

**Note on Job 3 (Sweet Briar College)**: While this was a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Engineering position that mentioned "materials" in the curriculum, it was excluded because Sweet Briar College is a private liberal arts college and does not hold an R1 research designation.
