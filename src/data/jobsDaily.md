Based on the filtering criteria (R1 institution, Tenure-Track status, and relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy/Characterization), none of the provided job opportunities qualify for inclusion. All jobs were either in irrelevant fields (e.g., Public Policy, Economics, Education, Computational Biology), were not tenure-track positions, or were located at institutions that are not classified as R1 Doctoral Universities (Very High Research Activity).
All 20 job opportunities provided were filtered out based on the mandatory criteria:
1. Irrelevant field (e.g., Education, Business, Kinesiology, Nursing, Social Sciences).
2. Not a tenure-track position (e.g., Faculty Associate, Non-Tenure Track Professional Professor).
3. The institution is not classified as an R1 research university (e.g., R2 or R3 institutions).

Therefore, no summaries will be generated.
(No jobs met all the required criteria: tenure-track, R1 institution, and relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy.)
