Based on your background in Materials Engineering and electron microscopy, and applying the criteria (Tenure-Track, R1 institution, and field relevance), none of the 20 jobs provided (Job 61 to Job 80) match your requirements.

The provided list consisted of positions in unrelated fields such as Nutrition, Art, Marketing, Library Science, Communication, Music, Media, Education, Actuarial Science, Management, Geospatial Information, English, and Electrical Power Systems. Additionally, several institutions listed (e.g., Lamar University, University of Nebraska at Omaha, Middle Georgia State University) are not classified as R1 research institutions.

As per your instructions to delete unrelated, non-tenure track, and non-R1 positions and provide no information on deleted jobs, there are no summaries to display for this batch.
Based on the criteria provided and the job descriptions for jobs 81 to 100, all positions have been filtered out for the following reasons:
