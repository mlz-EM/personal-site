Based on your background as a Materials Engineering PhD specializing in electron microscopy for microstructural characterization and structure-property relationships, and applying the filtering criteria:

1.  **Irrelevant fields**: Jobs in Languages & Linguistics, Hospitality, Finance, Business Analytics, Biology, Pure Mathematics, Management, History, Physical Education, Theology, Acting, Family and Consumer Sciences, Social Policy, and Ethnic Studies are all deemed completely irrelevant to your expertise.
2.  **Not tenure-track**: Jobs explicitly stating "Non-Tenure", "Teaching Professor", "Instructional Assistant Professor", or "No" for tenure-track status are excluded.
3.  **R1 status**: While some listed universities are R1 institutions (e.g., University of Virginia, University of Minnesota), the specific job opportunities they posted were either in irrelevant fields or not tenure-track for your specialization.

After reviewing all 20 job opportunities against these criteria, none of them are relevant or suitable for your profile. Therefore, no summaries will be generated.
