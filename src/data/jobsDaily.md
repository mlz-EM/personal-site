Based on your background as a Materials Engineering PhD specializing in electron microscopy for microscale material characterization and structure-property relationships, and your search for North American tenure-track faculty positions, I have filtered the provided job opportunities.

The majority of the positions were either not tenure-track, outside North America, or in fields completely unrelated to materials engineering or core sciences (e.g., philosophy, criminal justice, business, public service, music, biology/genomics, or highly administrative roles).

As per your instructions, if all work areas are irrelevant, I am to retain the two most relevant jobs. The two jobs below are the only ones that are explicitly tenure-track and within a STEM-related discipline (Engineering/Physics), even though they are at a community college and appear to be primarily teaching-focused rather than research-intensive R1/R2 university positions.
