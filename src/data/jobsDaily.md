I have reviewed the 20 job opportunities against your criteria: tenure-track status, R1 university classification (according to the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education), and relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy.

All 20 positions were filtered out based on these requirements:

*   **Job 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40:** Eliminated because the institution is not classified as R1 (Very High Research Activity).
*   **Job 21, 23, 29:** Eliminated due to being administrative (Provost), business/IT (Analyst), or irrelevant academic fields (AI in Business).
*   **Job 24, 28, 30, 31, 37, 39:** Eliminated because they are explicitly non-tenure track (Professor of Practice, Teaching Assistant Professor, Assistant Research Professor, NTT).

Therefore, no jobs remain to be summarized.
