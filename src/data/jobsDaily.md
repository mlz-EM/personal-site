Based on the filtering criteria (relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy, tenure-track status, and R1 institution status), none of the provided job opportunities meet all requirements.

1. Jobs 161, 163, 164, 165, and 166 were eliminated due to being completely unrelated fields (Writing, Sport Management, Management, Economics, and Law).
2. Jobs 167, 168, and 169 were eliminated because they were explicitly non-tenure track (Teaching Faculty/Specialized Teaching Faculty).
3. Jobs 162, 163, 164, and 165 were eliminated because the institutions (Cal Poly SLO, MTSU, NKU, CNU) are not classified as R1 research universities.

Therefore, there are no remaining jobs to summarize.
