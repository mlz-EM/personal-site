Based on the provided constraints:
1. The job must be relevant to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy (EM).
2. The job must be tenure-track (TT).
3. The school must be classified as an R1 institution (Very High Research Activity).

Reviewing the 20 potential opportunities:
*   Jobs 1, 6, 7, 8, 14, 18, and 19 were removed for being explicitly non-tenure-track (NTT) or staff/management positions.
*   Jobs 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 20 were removed for being in fields completely irrelevant to Materials Engineering (e.g., Public Health, Aquatic Ecology, Communication, Creative Writing, Finance, Political Science, Legal Writing, AI & Public Policy).
*   Jobs 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 16 were removed because the institutions (University of Tampa, York College of Pennsylvania, Eastern Mennonite University, Northern State University, Missouri State University, and Rochester Institute of Technology) are not classified as R1 institutions.

Since none of the provided job opportunities meet all three mandatory criteria (relevance, TT status, and R1 status), the resulting summary list is empty.
I have reviewed the 20 job opportunities based on the provided filtering criteria:
1. The job must be in a relevant STEM field (Materials Science, Engineering, or closely related physical sciences, excluding clinical/medical, arts, or management).
2. The job must be tenure-track.
3. The school must be classified as an R1 institution (Very High Research Activity).

Based on these strict criteria, all 20 jobs were filtered out. The reasons for deletion included being in irrelevant fields (e.g., Art, Law, Music, Astrophysics), being non-tenure-track (e.g., teaching faculty, professor of practice, internship), or being located at a non-R1 institution. Therefore, no summaries are generated.
