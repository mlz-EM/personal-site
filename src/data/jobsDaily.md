I have reviewed the 20 job opportunities based on the provided criteria: relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy, tenure-track status, and R1 classification. All 20 positions were filtered out because they were either in completely unrelated fields (e.g., Civics, Art History, Marketing, Public Health, Mathematics Education), explicitly non-tenure track (e.g., Teaching Faculty, Research Track, Fellowships), or located at institutions that are not classified as R1 Doctoral Universities.

Therefore, no summaries will be generated.
