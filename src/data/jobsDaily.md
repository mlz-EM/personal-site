I have reviewed all 20 potential job opportunities based on your criteria:
1.  **Field Relevance**: Removed jobs completely unrelated to Materials Engineering, Electron Microscopy for materials characterization, and structure-property relationships. This included positions in computing, business, education, pure biology (not bio-materials), entomology, architecture, music, and marine engineering.
2.  **Tenure Track Status**: Removed all non-tenure-track positions (e.g., "Professional Practice Faculty," "Teaching Professor").
3.  **R1 University Status**: Checked each university against the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education for R1 (Doctoral Universities â€“ Very High Research Activity) status. Jobs at non-R1 institutions were removed.

After applying these filters, none of the provided job opportunities met all the specified criteria. Therefore, there are no jobs remaining to be summarized.

I have carefully reviewed all 20 job opportunities based on your criteria:
1.  **Relevance to your background**: Materials Engineering PhD with expertise in electron microscopy for micro-scale material characterization and structure-property relationships.
2.  **Tenure-track status**: Only tenure-track positions are considered.
3.  **R1 university status**: Only R1 universities are considered.

After thorough evaluation, none of the provided job opportunities meet all three criteria. All jobs were either in completely unrelated fields (e.g., Mathematics, Psychology, Organic Chemistry, Criminal Justice, Interior Architecture, Microbiology, Public Health, Illustration, Landscape Architecture, Business Analytics, Agricultural Communications, Computer Science, Nursing, Graphic Design, Social Work, Immunology, Political Science), were not tenure-track, or were at universities not classified as R1.

Therefore, there are no jobs to summarize according to the specified format.
