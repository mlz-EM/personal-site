The provided list of job opportunities was filtered based on the following mandatory criteria:
1. Relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy.
2. Tenure-Track status.
3. Carnegie Classification R1 (Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity).

All 20 positions were eliminated because they were either in completely unrelated fields (e.g., Education, Music, Theatre, Aviation), were explicitly non-tenure-track (e.g., Professor of Practice, Instructional Professor), or were located at universities classified as R2 or lower (M1, M2, Baccalaureate/Associate) and thus did not meet the R1 requirement.

Therefore, no summaries can be generated.
(No jobs met all the required criteria: Tenure-Track, R1 institution, and relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy.)
Based on the strict filtering criteria (must be tenure-track, at an R1 institution, and relevant to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy), all 20 provided job opportunities were filtered out. Therefore, no summaries will be generated.
