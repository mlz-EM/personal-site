All provided job opportunities were filtered out because they were either not tenure-track, not at an R1 institution, or were in fields completely unrelated to Materials Engineering and Electron Microscopy (e.g., Social Work, Ethnic Studies, Finance, Architecture, Agronomy, or non-tenure-track positions in Education and Medicine).
Based on the strict filtering criteria (Tenure Track, R1 institution, and relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy/Characterization), all 20 provided job opportunities were filtered out.

The reasons for deletion were:
1. Irrelevant field (e.g., Screenwriting, Finance, Musicology, Social Work, Business Analytics).
2. Not Tenure Track (e.g., Research Track, Academic Professional Track, Faculty Associate).
3. Not R1 institution (e.g., UTRGV, Cal Poly SLO, Quinnipiac, UVU, Santa Clara).

Therefore, no summaries will be generated.
(No jobs met all the required criteria: R1 status, tenure-track status, and relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy.)
