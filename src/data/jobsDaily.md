Based on the strict criteria provided (Materials Engineering field, Tenure-Track status, and R1 University classification), none of the 20 job opportunities listed match your background and requirements. 

Below is a brief explanation of the filtering results:

1.  **Field Irrelevance**: All 20 jobs are in fields completely unrelated to Materials Engineering or Electron Microscopy (e.g., Social Work, Graphic Design, Accounting, Business, Music, Special Education, and Creative Writing).
2.  **Non-Tenure Track**: Several positions (Jobs 3, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, and 19) were specifically identified as non-tenure track, adjunct, or postdoctoral fellowships.
3.  **Non-R1 Status**: The majority of the schools listed (e.g., SUNY Geneseo, Ball State, Troy University, Missouri State, etc.) are classified as R2 or Master's Universities, not R1. While USC and Indiana University are R1, the specific departments (Social Work and African American Studies) are not relevant to your research.

As per your instructions to "delete the completely irrelevant work" and "not contain information on the already deleted work," no summaries have been generated.
Based on the criteria provided (Materials Engineering background, Tenure-Track position, and R1 University status), none of the 20 job opportunities (Job 21–Job 40) qualify for a summary. 

The provided list was filtered as follows:
1.  **Unrelated Fields**: Jobs in Psychology (21, 30, 33), African American Studies (23), Political Science (24), Aviation (25), Education (26, 32, 35), Energy Finance (28), Physical Education (29), Marketing (31), Business (34), Real Estate (36), Music/Audio Engineering (37), Computational Social Science (38), Classics (39), and Neurology (40) were removed.
2.  **Non-Tenure Track**: Positions such as Laboratory Manager (22), Teaching Assistant Professor (24), Professor of Practice (28), and Non-Tenure System Faculty (36) were removed.
3.  **Non-R1 Institutions**: Schools such as Missouri State, University of Minnesota Duluth, Western Michigan, Northern State, Sweet Briar College, Graceland University, Texas A&M Victoria, Georgia Southwestern, Eastern Kentucky, Mayville State, National Louis, and Montclair State are not classified as R1 Research Universities.

As a result, no jobs remain to be summarized.
