All job opportunities provided were filtered out based on the specified criteria:
1.  **Irrelevant Field**: Many jobs were in fields like Writing, Statistics, Nursing, Safety, Actuarial Science, Religion, Educational Neuroscience, Management, Aerospace (operations-focused), Computer Science, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Political Science, Economics, and Early Childhood Studies, which are not related to Materials Engineering or electron microscopy for materials characterization.
2.  **Not Tenure-Track**: Some jobs were explicitly non-tenure track (e.g., fellowships, research scientist appointments).
3.  **Not R1 University**: Several universities were identified as R2 (Doctoral Universities â€“ High Research Activity) or other classifications (Master's, Baccalaureate, Associate's Colleges), not meeting the R1 (Doctoral Universities â€“ Very High Research Activity) requirement.
4.  **Vague Description**: One job (job 121) was too generic, lacking any departmental or specific research area information to assess its relevance to Materials Engineering.

Therefore, no jobs met all the criteria for inclusion in the summary.
