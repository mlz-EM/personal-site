Please note that after applying your criteria:
1. **Job 161** (Political Science), **Job 162** (Education), **Job 163** (Criminal Justice), and **Job 168** (Humanities) were removed as they are in fields completely unrelated to Materials Engineering.
2. **Job 165, 166, 167, and 168** were removed because they are "Faculty Associate" positions, which are explicitly described as non-tenure track, fixed-term appointments with no tenure implications.
3. **Job 161, 162, 163, and 164** were further evaluated for school R1 status. Texas A&M University-Texarkana, Mississippi Valley State University, North Carolina Central University, and Morgan State University are currently not classified as R1 institutions.
