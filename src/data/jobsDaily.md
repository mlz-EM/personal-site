Based on the strict filtering criteria (must be tenure-track, must be at an R1 institution, and must be relevant to Materials Engineering/STEM), all 16 provided job opportunities were eliminated:

*   Jobs 161, 170, 172, and 175 were eliminated because they are explicitly non-tenure-track (Faculty of Practice, Instructor, Research Scientist, or Open Pool Instructor).
*   Jobs 162, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 171, and 176 were eliminated as they are in completely irrelevant fields (Writing, Education, Social Work, Plant Biology, Management, Economics, Finance, History, Medieval Studies).
*   Jobs 163, 164, 165, 167, 168, 169, 171, 173, and 174 were eliminated because the schools (Wilkes University, Ithaca College, Cal Poly, MTSU, NKU, Prince George's Community College) are not classified as R1 institutions.

Therefore, no jobs remain for summary.
