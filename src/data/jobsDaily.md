All 20 job opportunities provided were filtered out based on the criteria:
1. Irrelevant field (e.g., Fashion Design, Philosophy, Criminal Justice, Social Science, Humanities, Medicine).
2. Not tenure-track (e.g., Research Professor, Teaching Faculty, Postdoctoral Fellow/Fellowship).
3. School is not classified as an R1 institution (Very High Research Activity) by the Carnegie Classification.

Therefore, no summaries will be generated.
Based on the provided constraints (must be R1 institution, tenure-track, and relevant to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy), all 20 job opportunities were filtered out. The primary reasons for deletion were: the position was non-tenure track (NTT/Term/Post-doc), the institution was not classified as R1, or the field was completely irrelevant (e.g., Humanities, Business, Clinical Medicine, or Computer Science).
Based on the provided criteria (Materials Science/Engineering relevance, Tenure-Track status, and R1 Carnegie Classification), all 10 job postings were filtered out:

*   Jobs 161, 163, 166, 169, 170 were filtered due to being in unrelated fields (Nursing, Marketing, Biochemistry, Anatomy/Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry Lab Coordination) or being non-TT/staff roles.
*   Jobs 162, 164, 165 were filtered because the institutions (James Madison University, North Carolina Central University, Oakland University) are classified as R2, not R1.
*   Jobs 167, 168 were filtered because they are explicitly non-tenure-track Faculty Associate positions.

Therefore, no jobs remain to be summarized in the requested format.
