(No jobs met all criteria: R1 institution, Tenure-Track status, and relevance to Materials Engineering/Electron Microscopy.)
All 20 job opportunities were filtered out based on the provided criteria: they were either not tenure-track (TT), not at an R1 institution, or were in fields completely irrelevant to Materials Science and Electron Microscopy (e.g., Agricultural Economics, Business Analytics, Computer Science, Graphic Design, or non-North American locations). Therefore, no summaries are generated.
All potential job opportunities provided were filtered out based on the strict requirements: they were either not tenure-track, in an unrelated field (e.g., Nursing, Mathematics, Cybersecurity), or the associated institution was not classified as an R1 Doctoral University (Very High Research Activity) according to the Carnegie Classification. Therefore, no summaries are generated.
