Based on the criteria provided (R1 University, Tenure-Track status, and relevance to Materials Engineering or Electron Microscopy), none of the 20 job opportunities provided (Jobs 101-120) meet the requirements for inclusion. 

The provided listings primarily cover fields such as Medicine, Education, Law, Business, and Liberal Arts, or are located at non-R1 institutions (e.g., UM-Flint, Oakland University, MTSU). Additionally, several roles are non-tenure track "Professor of Practice" or staff-level research positions.
Based on the criteria provided (Tenure-Track, R1 University, and Materials Engineering/Characterization field), none of the job opportunities listed (Job 121 to Job 140) are suitable. 

The reasons for exclusion are as follows:
- **Unrelated Fields**: Most positions were in unrelated disciplines such as Youth Development, Music, Criminal Justice, Early Childhood Education, Finance, Communication, or Game AI.
- **Non-Tenure Track**: Several positions at R1 institutions (e.g., University of Florida, University of Georgia, Florida State University, and UTEP) were explicitly listed as non-tenure track, research faculty, or teaching faculty.
- **Non-R1 Institutions**: Positions at schools such as Northeastern State University, Bethel University, University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, SUNY Plattsburgh, Cleveland State University, and Barnard College do not meet the R1 research university requirement.

No summaries have been generated as no jobs remained after the screening process.
