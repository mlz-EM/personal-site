- **Authors**: Yaozhu Li, Szilvia Kalácska, Phil McCausland, Roberta L. Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To perform a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the non-poikilitic lithology of the Martian meteorite NWA 7721 to understand its pre-impact deformation history.
- **Finding**: Multiscale analysis, including electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), revealed a bimodal microstructure: fine, strain-free Type 1 subgrains (shock-induced recrystallization products) and coarse, strongly strained Type 2 subgrains (preserving the deformed parent grain). This microstructure provides the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars, suggesting the olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before the impact event.

**36. [The Microscopic Structure of Stacking Faults in $\mathrm{Sr}_{2}\mathrm{NaNb}_{5}\mathrm{O}_{15}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06983v2)**
- **Authors**: Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland
- **Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the microscopic structure and influence of regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze ferroic material $\mathrm{Sr}_{2}\mathrm{NaNb}_{5}\mathrm{O}_{15}$.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and force-field calculations revealed that the stacking faults, possessing a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_{o}$, annihilate in sets of four, resulting in four possible directions of the $S_{3}$ order parameter related to $\mathrm{NbO}_{6}$ octahedral tilts. TEM analysis showed that these faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, suggesting they could strongly influence the material's ferroelectric properties.

HRTEM atomic-scale imaging provided direct insight into the mechanism, showing both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, accompanied by gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns driven by interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics.

**50. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part II - COMSOL Simulation and Apparatus Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03821v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of irregular crystallization in ZBLAN glass under vibration using finite element modeling (FEM) and to redesign the experimental apparatus for stable thermal contact.
- **Finding**: FEM simulations confirmed that intermittent thermal contact caused by vibration reduced heat transfer efficiency. The redesigned apparatus ensured uniform heating, and subsequent experiments showed that higher vibration frequencies ($\sim 100~\mathrm{Hz}$) accelerate nucleation and reduce the effective fiber-drawing temperature window by about $30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. *EM Contribution*: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses confirmed that vibrations promote the transformation of partially crystallized ZBLAN into well-developed crystalline structures, emphasizing the need for precise thermal and vibrational control.
