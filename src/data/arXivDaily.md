**10. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware metric, addressing the limitations of the conventional contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that SSNR provides a more accurate, dose-aware assessment for STEM phase retrieval methods. While center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography showed dose-independent SSNRs, iterative ptychography exhibited a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography's SSNR at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with maximum detective quantum efficiency.

This setup offers new opportunities for the spectroscopy of inherently weak magnetic dipole transitions.

- **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements for direct ptychography by formulating parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to it.
- **Finding**: The study formulated parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, which enabled scan-upsampling in direct ptychography, thereby relaxing its traditional resolution limitation tied to probe step size. This insight allows for more flexible data acquisition in electron ptychography while maintaining high-resolution phase retrieval.

Electron microscopy (including reflection high-energy electron diffraction) indicated that this phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface.

- **Finding**: Using high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy, the study solved the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures, revealing that both materials undergo an achiral-to-chiral phase transition. The chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms, and a spatially varying piezoelectric response was observed, consistent with an external electric-strain-field coupling for switching chirality.

At the second and third stages, two kinds of texture, (110),111 and (110),115, were observed, with grain sizes around 200 nm, decreasing at the third stage due to lower temperature. The results from PED on TEM were in agreement with XRD, confirming the preferred [110] direction along the axial direction, which is beneficial for axial tensile strength.

This approach enables axially super-resolved label-free imaging of whole cells in the range of 30-200 nm. Electron array tomography played a crucial role in validating and correlating the results, showcasing the potential for multimodal 3D colorimetric histology at the (sub-)organelle level.

-   **Finding**: The study reveals long-range A-type antiferromagnetic order at $T_N = 4.5$ K with strong magnetic anisotropy in GdZn$_3$P$_3$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments were crucial in demonstrating the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. This finding likely explains the metallic conductivity and anomaly at $T_N$, establishing GdZn$_3$P$_3$ as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carriers and triangular lattice magnetism.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-10
-   **Objective**: To identify the kinetic limitations of confined reactions by studying the dynamics of graphene etching in the van der Waals (vdW) gap between multilayer graphene and a platinum substrate.
-   **Finding**: Using in situ scanning electron microscopy, the study revealed that graphene etching reaction rates by various molecules (O$_2$, H$_2$, and CO) are limited by mass transport within the confined vdW gap. This limitation persists even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting of the vdW gap. In situ SEM was essential for observing these dynamic etching processes under controlled conditions, demonstrating the vdW gap's potential as an effective nanoreactor once mass-transport limitations are overcome.

-   **Finding**: The study demonstrates that carefully chosen, relatively small update strengths for both the object and probe are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential in atomic-resolution low-dose imaging. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic FAPbBr$_3$ sample, it was shown that convergence is practically achievable only with small update strengths, highlighting the existence of critical values beyond which algorithms can be trapped in local minima. These findings are crucial for optimizing reconstruction parameters in iterative electron ptychography to ensure effective convergence and correctness of results.

-   **Objective**: To uncover the mechanistic insights into metal-support interactions in heterogeneous catalysts during redox reactions, specifically focusing on NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ catalysts during hydrogen oxidation.
-   **Finding**: Utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy, the study revealed a novel "looping" metal-support interaction where lattice oxygens at NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ interfaces react with NiFe-activated H atoms, leading to dynamic migration of interfaces. Simultaneously, reduced iron atoms migrate to the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support surface and react with oxygen. Operando TEM was critical for observing these atomic-scale dynamics and demonstrating that the hydrogen oxidation reaction separates spatially on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-04
-   **Objective**: To address the challenge of misaligned cropping of diffraction patterns in ptychography by developing an automatic differentiation (AD)-based approach for subpixel correction of shifts.
-   **Finding**: The proposed AD-based method treats the cropping shift as an optimizable parameter within the reconstruction framework, simultaneously refining the object, probe, and shift positions without requiring manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that, even with initial offsets ranging up to 5 pixels, the method achieves subpixel correction, with an average deviation below 0.5 pixels. Experiments in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime further validate the method's robustness and effectiveness, enhancing the automation and robustness of ptychographic reconstructions.
