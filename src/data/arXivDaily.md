**1. [Establishment of global phase coherence in a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB2 nanocomposite: Roles of interface, morphology and defect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23616v1)**
- **Authors**: Iku Nakaaki, Aoi Hashimoto, Shun Kondo, Yuichi Ikuhara, Shuuichi Ooi, Minoru Tachiki, Shunichi Arisawa, Akiko Nakamura, Taku Moronaga, Jun Chen, Hiroyo Segawa, Takahiro Sakurai, Hitoshi Ohta, Takashi Uchino
- **Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the relationship between structural disorder and the establishment of superconducting phase coherence in a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB$_2$ nanocomposite.
- **Finding**: 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data revealed that the complex MgO/MgB$_2$ microstructure spreads isotropically with a constant fractal dimension of ~$1.67$. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) showed atomically clean and coherent MgO/MgB$_2$ interfaces, free from amorphous grain boundaries. Spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence measurements demonstrated that oxygen vacancies in the MgO-rich phase aggregate near the MgO/MgB$_2$ boundaries, forming long channels that contribute to long-range carrier transfer and Andreev reflection, explaining the bulk-like superconducting properties despite low MgB$_2$ volume fraction.

- **Finding**: A transition in V-doping behavior was observed in WS$_2$ monolayers: at low concentrations, V-dopants enhance native optical properties without introducing new electronic states, while at higher concentrations, they promote V-sulfur vacancy complexes that generate tunable mid-gap states. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used, in combination with photoluminescence microscopy and first-principles calculations, to identify attractive interactions between p-type V-dopants and n-type monosulfur vacancies, providing mechanistic understanding of how enthalpic dopant-defect interactions versus entropic effects govern the balance between property enhancement versus perturbation.

Through simulation and application to experimental data, the electrostatic potential of a monolithic SrTiO$_3$ crystal was reconstructed, showing good quantitative agreement with the expected structure. This demonstrates the robustness of the approach for thick samples where multiple scattering cannot be neglected.

- **Finding**: Oxygen scavenging by an Eu adlayer at the Eu/BaBiO$_3$ heterointerface leads to the formation of EuO$_x$ and the superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$, exhibiting emergent superconductivity at 6 K. Electron microscopy measurements, combined with X-ray diffraction, were used to confirm the structural and chemical interactions and the formation of BaBi$_3$. The superconducting state was found to be quasi-two-dimensional, with an in-plane upper critical field significantly exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit, possibly reflecting features of Ising superconductivity due to strong spin-orbit coupling at Bi sites.

- **Authors**: M. H. Mostafa, M. S. Mirmoosa, E. Galiffi, S. Yin, A. Alù, S. A. Tretyakov
- **Date**: 2025-06-25
- **Objective**: To theoretically demonstrate broadband amplification of light through adiabatic spatiotemporal modulation, overcoming the need for rapid sub-cycle temporal responses in optical materials.
- **Finding**: Broadband amplification can be achieved using adiabatic spatiotemporal modulation patterns, compatible with recent demonstrations of temporal modulation in epsilon-near-zero materials. The same phenomenon can also be realized by modulating bianisotropic nonreciprocal media in time. This broadband gain mechanism opens new avenues for generating high-energy, ultrashort optical pulses, with potential impact in ultrafast optics and electron microscopy, although electron microscopy was mentioned as a potential application area rather than a technique used in the study itself.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to indicate this high-temperature thermal treatment induces irreversible lattice expansion. The method enables high-resolution tuning up to 5.25 bits, is effective across a broadband spectrum, and stable for over 218 days, demonstrating its universality for precisely calibrating MZIs on a single wafer.

Electron microscopy results, specifically aberration-corrected (Cs-corrected) high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), confirmed the core-intermediate-outermost layer composition (Bi$_2$Te$_3$-Sb$_2$Te$_3$-Bi$_2$Te$_3$) and analyzed the in-plane heterojunctions, revealing strong epitaxial alignment between individual layers and with the hBN substrate. The resulting heterostructures were approximately 4-8 nm thick and several hundred nanometers in lateral dimensions, and their plasmonic properties were explored.

- **Finding**: A novel high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method was introduced, enabling full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals, eliminating a long-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis. The method's robustness was demonstrated in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even in overlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. Simulations revealed that fault-induced de-channeling is key to contrast formation, allowing for a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae bounded by the stacking fault itself for enhanced atomic-scale studies.

- **Authors**: Shivani Sharma, Pooja Jain, Benny Schundelmier, Chin-Wei Wang, Poonam Yadav, Adrienn Maria Szucs, Kaya Wei, N. P. Lalla, Theo Siegrist
- **Date**: 2025-06-16
- **Objective**: To conduct a comprehensive study of the Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Co$_2$O$_4$ (GMCO) system, focusing on the influence of Mn substitution on its crystal and magnetic structure, and to understand observed structural inhomogeneities.
- **Finding**: Phase separation was observed in GMCO (Ge$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Co$_2$O$_4$), predominantly consisting of a Mn-rich primary phase and a minor Ge-rich secondary phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was crucial in revealing these distinct phases and their approximate stoichiometries. While both phases crystallize in cubic symmetry at room temperature, they exhibit different low-temperature magnetic orders (ferrimagnetic for Mn-rich, antiferromagnetic for Ge-rich), and the estimated magnetic entropy is significantly suppressed, indicating complex magneto-structural behavior influenced by the inhomogeneities.

- **Authors**: Marco Moreira, Yves Fleming, Patrick Grysan, Christele Vergne, Adrian Marie Philippe, Petru Lunca-Popa
- **Date**: 2025-06-16
- **Objective**: To investigate how various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) influence the structure and properties of Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.
- **Finding**: Doping of Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films with various extrinsic dopants resulted in limited actual dopant incorporation, with only Al and Sc present above detection. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that films grown on c-plane sapphire were epitaxial near the substrate interface but relaxed into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon were polycrystalline throughout. Despite limited incorporation, subtle structural and optical shifts were observed, suggesting that dopant precursor chemistry and growth conditions significantly influence film stoichiometry and properties.

- **Authors**: Sebastian Lellig, Subisha Balakumar, Peter Schweizer, Eva P. Mayer, Simon Evertz, Marcus Hans, Damian M. Holzapfel, Yin Du, Qing Zhou, Martin Dienwiebel, Johann Michler, Jochen M. Schneider
- **Date**: 2025-06-13
- **Objective**: To design artificial sulfur-free zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by controlling their chain length through thermal annealing.
- **Finding**: As-deposited zinc phosphate coatings were classified as metaphosphates, and increasing annealing temperature reduced their chain lengths, as evidenced by XPS data indicating a loss of phosphorus and oxygen from the surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line scans showed that this composition change occurred throughout the entire coating thickness. This alteration in composition and chain length reduction led to a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and improved wear resistance, demonstrating that the mechanical properties of artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via thermally stimulated composition changes.
