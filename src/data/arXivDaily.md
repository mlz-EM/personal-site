**3. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, magnetic, and magnetotransport properties in $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as a function of the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{Fe}$), focusing on the percolation threshold.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To analyze the atomic-scale distribution and segregation of oxygen at grain boundaries (GBs) in $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}$-encapsulated $\text{Nb}$ thin films used for superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided atomic-scale evidence of oxygen segregation at GBs in both film types, with enrichment factors ($C_{gb}/C_{grain}$) up to $2.7$ in $\text{Nb}$ films. This atomic-scale chemical analysis revealed that higher oxygen concentration in the $\text{Nb}$ grains correlates with greater segregation at GBs, which in turn suppresses the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), offering insight into decoherence mechanisms.

- **Authors**: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural heterogeneity-driven enhancement of transverse thermoelectric conversion (Anomalous Ettingshausen effect) in functionally graded materials (FGMs) using thermoelectric imaging.
- **Finding**: Structural analyses using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) revealed the presence of $\text{Fe}$-based crystalline alloys and $\text{Cu}$ nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix. This nanoscale structural heterogeneity, confirmed by STEM/APT, accounts for the pronounced non-monotonic enhancement of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect observed via lock-in thermography (LIT) well before bulk crystallization.

- **Objective**: To generate unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) by patterning continuous phase gradients in tungsten ($\text{W}$) thin films using direct-write laser annealing.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was essential in tracking the continuous crystalline transformation of the $\text{W}$ films from the high-resistivity $\beta$ phase to the low-resistivity $\alpha$ phase as laser fluence increased. This microstructural characterization confirmed the ability to create precise phase gradients, which, when interfaced with $\text{CoFeB}$, enabled magnetization switching without an applied magnetic field.

- **Objective**: To perform *in situ* observations of phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl ($\mathrm{8CB}$) liquid crystal using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy ($\mathrm{LP}$-$\mathrm{STEM}$).
- **Finding**: The electron beam induces consecutive phase changes ($\mathrm{SmA} \rightarrow \mathrm{N}$ and $\mathrm{N} \rightarrow \mathrm{I}$), with kinetics dependent on dose rate, indicating that the phenomena are primarily thermal in nature due to local heat generation. Electron microscopy contribution: This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using **LP-STEM**, allowing for real-time, *in situ* observation of phase transitions, spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and process reversibility in nanoconfined liquid crystals.

**29. [Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $SrVO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843v1)**
- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a direct and controllable approach for recovering the intrinsic metallic character of $\mathrm{SrVO}_{3}$ ($\mathrm{SVO}$) surfaces by thermally reducing the oxidized near-surface region ($\mathrm{NSR}$) under ultra-high vacuum.
- **Finding**: Thermal reduction causes a sharp transformation from a $\mathrm{V}^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states dominated by $\mathrm{V}^{4+}$, recovering the metallic character. This transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and structural surface reorganization, rather than $\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ volatilization. Electron microscopy contribution: **High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM)**, combined with $\mathrm{XRD}$ and $\mathrm{AFM}$, was used *ex situ* to suggest that the transformation leads to nanoscale surface reorganization and modest lattice expansion.
