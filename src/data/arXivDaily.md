- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in ultrathin $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness is varied, focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction revealed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when the $\text{Fe}$ thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) dropped below $30 \text{ \AA}$; this microstructural evolution, confirmed by HRTEM, coincided with a critical exponent consistent with 2D-disordered systems and a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) scaling mechanism.

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To provide clear evidence regarding the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_{2}$ films using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
- **Finding**: The observed XLD signal in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_{2}$ films was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field, strongly suggesting a nonmagnetic origin, contrary to predictions for altermagnetism; Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) was used in conjunction with XLD to probe the material, establishing XLD as a robust technique for characterizing low-symmetry materials.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analyses of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) in $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}$-capped $\text{Nb}$ thin films used in superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: **Atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** revealed significant oxygen segregation at GBs in both film types. The oxygen enrichment factor ($C_{\text{gb}}/C_{\text{grain}}$) for $\text{Nb}$ GBs was $2.7$ (or $2.3$ in $\text{Ta}$-capped films). Increased oxygen concentration in both grains and GBs correlates with a suppression of the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), suggesting a mechanism for decoherence.

- **Objective**: To investigate how graded structural heterogeneity in functionally graded materials (FGMs) influences transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion, specifically the anomalous Ettingshausen effect.
- **Finding**: Lock-in thermography revealed a non-monotonic enhancement of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect in the atomic-heterogeneity regime, before full crystallization. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT)** confirmed the presence of structural heterogeneity, specifically $\text{Fe}$-based crystalline alloys and $\text{Cu}$ nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix, which is responsible for the enhanced transverse response.

- **Authors**: Asato Onishi, Zifan Xu, Cédric Bareille, Yoichi Kageyama, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Taniuchi, Takasada Shibauchi
- **Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Objective**: To visualize the energy dependence of $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbital anisotropy (orbital nematicity) in real space within individual nematic domains of the $\text{Fe}$-based superconductor $\text{Ba}_{1-x}\text{Na}_x\text{Fe}_2\text{As}_2$.
- **Finding**: Using $5.82 \text{-eV}$ laser-excited **photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM)**, a sign reversal of the linear dichroic (LD) contrast was discovered at an energy $\sim 0.4 \text{ eV}$ below the Fermi level. This finding directly reveals an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain, underscoring the critical role of orbital-selective coherence in the nematic phase.

- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop a comprehensive quantum theory for electron-photon interaction that explicitly includes the two-photon process and clarifies the relationship between PINEM, Kapitza-Dirac (KD), and nonlinear Compton scattering effects.

Quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes affects the resulting electron energy states and entanglement. The KD effect and nonlinear Compton scattering are identified as specific manifestations of the two-photon process, providing a unified framework for understanding electron-photon quantum interactions in **electron microscopy** settings.

- **Authors**: Lauren J. Riddiford, Anne Flechsig, Shilei Ding, Emir Karadza, Niklas Kercher, Tobias Goldenberger, Elisabeth Müller, Pietro Gambardella, Laura J. Heyderman, Aleš Hrabec
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To generate unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) by creating controlled, patterned phase gradients in tungsten ($\text{W}$) thin films using direct-write laser annealing to enable field-free magnetization switching.

When interfaced with $\text{CoFeB}$, $\text{W}$ wires with a sufficient phase gradient could switch the magnetization without an external magnetic field.

- **Authors**: Megan A. Householder, Tamilarasan Subramani, Kristina Lilova, James R. Lyons, Rhonda M. Stroud, Alexandra Navrotsky
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To report the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite ($\text{MgSiO}_3$) nanoparticles using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry.

- **Authors**: Keyu Cao, Sashank Shivakumar, Jian Luo
- **Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Objective**: To fabricate dense ultrafine-grained (UFG) refractory alloys and investigate the role of cobalt ($\text{Co}$) doping (2 at.\%) in enhancing sintering density and suppressing high-temperature grain growth.
- **Finding**: $\text{Co}$ doping increased relative densities (up to $96\text{-}98\%$) and suppressed the relative grain growth rate, especially in compositionally complex alloys, supporting the high-entropy grain boundary (HEGB) effect. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)** confirmed strong $\text{Co}$ segregation at grain boundaries, accompanied by minor depletion of $\text{Ta}$ and $\text{W}$.

- **Date**: 2025-12-31
- **Objective**: To determine how the confined geometry of palladium ($\text{Pd}$) nanocrystals influences the structural dynamics and pathways of the $\alpha/\beta\text{-}\text{PdH}_x$ phase transformation during hydrogenation.
- **Finding**: **In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM)** directly visualized hydrogenation in $\text{Pd}$ nanocubes and hexagonal nanoplates. Both followed similar nucleation sequences, but their $\alpha/\beta\text{-}\text{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibited geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. Theoretical simulations confirmed that geometry dictates the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways when the system is driven far from equilibrium.

This demonstrated that reconstruction is governed by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local minima in the surface energy landscape.

The technique allowed for the visualization of spontaneous disclination formation and demonstrated the reversibility of the process, establishing LP-STEM as a powerful tool for studying nanoconfined LCs.

- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate how tungsten ($\text{W}$) concentration influences short-range order (SRO), grain boundary chemistry, and mechanical deformation behavior in $\text{Ni-xW}$ alloys.
- **Finding**: Strong SRO emerges when $\text{W}$ content exceeds $\sim 30 \text{ wt}\%$, promoting planar slip and twin formation and significantly enhancing strain-hardening capacity. **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** was used to observe the microstructure and deformation mechanisms, while **atom probe tomography (APT)** characterized grain boundary chemistry. The $\text{Ni-38W}$ alloy exhibited an exceptionally high Hall-Petch coefficient ($k_y \approx 1100 \text{ MPa } \mu\text{m}^{1/2}$).

The biomineralization process was determined to be controlled by multiple ion-exchange reactions involving $\text{Ca}$, $\text{Mg}$, $\text{Si}$, and $\text{P}$.

Optimal fusion of these two complementary channels in Fourier space yields transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity, enabling dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction for advanced **STEM** applications.
