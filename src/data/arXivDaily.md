**1. [Thermal and Size Effects in Ferroelastic Domains by Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10629v1)**
- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate how temperature influences the thickness-dependent monopolar-to-dipolar crossover in ferroelastic domain wall (DW) behavior in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: *In situ* heating Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), combined with machine-learning image analysis, revealed a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness. DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) are mobile near the Curie temperature ($T_C$) and freeze upon cooling, whereas DWs in the crossover regime (200-300 nm) are nearly static. STEM provided the necessary high-resolution visualization for tracking DW curvature and density across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes.

**2. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform direct real-space imaging of ultrasmall nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{B}20$-structured $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ crystals using Fresnel Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM).
- **Finding**: LTEM studies using the Fresnel mode revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon when conventional chiral discrimination methods were applied. Systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations attributed these chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function (CTF), establishing quantitative limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall skyrmions.

**3. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies observed in a Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet and determine if they are evidence of chiral spin textures (Topological Hall Effect).
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed but showed little correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions. Crucially, additional Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) measurements ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in the ferrimagnet. The anomalies were thus attributed to trivial mechanisms, specifically the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity.

- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) experiments on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation. This experimental validation, supported by analytical modeling and micromagnetic simulations, directly implicated strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism for manipulating 3D skyrmion strings.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models with respect to imaging conditions in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).
- **Finding**: By generating synthetic HRTEM data using multislice simulation and employing the HRTEM contrast transfer function (CTF) to quantify OOD domain shifts, the study demonstrated that neural network segmentation models exhibit significant performance stability but predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. This framework allows for precise investigation and quantification of generalization behavior critical for deploying neural networks in experimental HRTEM workflows.

- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis of $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys revealed significant compressive strain, up to 25%, near grain boundaries. Density functional theory calculations, informed by these structural observations, showed that $K_{\rm u}$ becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain, highlighting the critical influence of lattice distortions observed by EM on magnetic properties.

- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To manipulate and observe the spatial evolution of strain-induced spin rearrangement, specifically helical domain reorientation, under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress.
- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) observations revealed that helical phase reorientation is mediated by magnetic topological defects through processes analogous to plastic deformation in metals ("break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation"). LTEM provided direct visualization of these nanoscale spin rearrangement mechanisms, advancing the understanding of strain-driven magnetism.

**10. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the emergence and control of surface spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) in chiral magnets, focusing on the fundamental role of the phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that $\phi_0$ acts as a fundamental control parameter governing the presence, shape, and topological charge of SS. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed the formation of SSs at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, validating the theoretical predictions regarding $\phi_0$ control.

- **Finding**: Computational and experimental results showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier. Electron microscopy, alongside *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction, was used for direct visualization, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation kinetics.

**17. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field mapping using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC)-STEM.
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations demonstrated that DPC-STEM measurements are highly vulnerable to instrumental variations. Defocus significantly underestimates the electrostatic field magnitude (e.g., up to 30% underestimation for a 30 mrad probe). The analysis underscores that optimized instrumental alignment is critical for achieving accurate Center-of-Mass (CoM) based STEM imaging and electrostatic field quantification.

- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize "e-coherent" crystalline interfaces, where local non-affine transformations enhance coherency by introducing additional coincidence sites.
- **Finding**: Atomistic simulations and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) demonstrated the existence of e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries.

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects ($\text{ANE}$) in $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{N}$ thin films and correlate the observed two-component behavior with structural anisotropy.
- **Finding**: Tetragonal films ($x=0.8$ and $1$) exhibit two-component behavior in their Hall and Nernst hysteresis loops, resulting from the coexistence of two crystallographic orientations (a-axis and c-axis normal to the surface) combined with opposite signs of the anomalous effects along these axes (as predicted by DFT). *EM Contribution:* Electron microscopy experiments were crucial for characterizing the structural phases and orientations, confirming the small tetragonal distortion realized for $x>0.35$ and the presence of mixed crystallographic orientations.

- **Objective**: To study how the substrate miscut angle of c-plane sapphire affects the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting properties of molecular beam epitaxy ($\text{MBE}$)-grown niobium nitride ($\text{NbN}$) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle (up to $10^\circ$) significantly improved the structural quality (rocking curve FWHM reduced from $76~\text{arcsecs}$ to $20~\text{arcsecs}$) and marginally increased the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$ from $12.1~\text{K}$ to $12.5~\text{K}$). *EM Contribution:* Scanning transmission electron microscopy ($\text{STEM}$) images determined that the critical thickness for $\text{NbN}$ on c-sapphire is around $10~\text{nm}$, above which the film transitions to a columnar growth, regardless of the substrate miscut angle.

- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism by which edge dislocations, rather than traditional screw dislocations, control strength in certain refractory complex concentrated alloys ($\text{RCCAs}$) at high temperatures.
- **Finding**: Increasing the V content in the $\text{Nb-Ta-Ti-V}$ system induces substantial atomic misfit, which preferentially raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This drives a gradual mechanistic transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures. *EM Contribution:* Scanning transmission electron microscopy ($\text{STEM}$) was integrated with *in situ* neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations to structurally characterize the dislocation configurations and confirm the transition mechanism.
