**1. [Epitaxially-stabilized growth of wüstite FeO on 4H-SiC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02531v1)**
- **Authors**: Faisal Kimbugwe, Marzieh Baan, Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Roberto C Myers, Tyler J Grassman
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To report on the successful epitaxial growth of wüstite FeO thin films on 4H-SiC and characterize their properties.
- **Finding**: The study successfully grew up to 180 nm thick $(111)$-oriented FeO heteroepitaxial films on 4H-SiC$(0001)$ using molecular beam epitaxy. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) collectively confirmed the epilayer as phase-pure wüstite FeO with atomically sharp FeO/SiC interfaces. These techniques also revealed a slight misfit strain-induced rhombohedral distortion in the films, demonstrating the power of epitaxial stabilization for integrating thermodynamically unstable materials.

**2. [Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02234v2)**
- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate how substrate morphology can be used to control the strain state and phase transitions in V$_2$O$_3$ Mott insulator thin films.
- **Finding**: The researchers found that minute changes in substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped) can reverse the dominant strain in V$_2$O$_3$ films, shifting from compressive (lattice mismatch) to tensile (thermal expansion mismatch). High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) was crucial for imaging atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in the V$_2$O$_3$, elucidating the strain relaxation mechanism. This control over strain allows for either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases across all temperatures, leading to orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity.

**3. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) can improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging by enabling continuously non-zero contrast transfer even in the presence of higher-order aberrations.
- **Finding**: The study shows that acBF, which combines tilt-corrected bright-field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC), maintains continuously non-zero contrast transfer within the information limit, even with higher-order aberrations. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF CTF. The method was demonstrated on both simulated and experimental data acquired using 4D-STEM, showing superior performance compared to tcBF or DPC methods alone.

- **Finding**: The study successfully fabricated ZnSe-MoSe$_2$ and ZnSe-WSe$_2$ core-shell nanowires using a two-step growth process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was extensively used for characterizing the as-grown nanostructures, revealing that the morphology of the TMD shell can be precisely controlled by optimizing the selenization temperature. This control arises from different growth mechanisms at varying temperatures, offering promising avenues for advanced nanoscale applications by extending these trends to other semiconductor NW and TMD core-shell heterostructures.

- **Finding**: The study characterized the crystal structure, composition, and microstructure of Al-Mg-Si alloys using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Critically, the electrical resistivity of individual microstructural components (Al solid solution matrix, Si, and Mg$_2$Si precipitates) was directly measured using a microscale four-point probe setup inside an SEM. They found the Al solid solution matrix to be up to 15% more resistive than pure Al, dependent on heat treatment, and regions with precipitates were equally resistive, correlating microscopic electrical properties with microstructure and composition.

- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ and understand its spatial fluctuations.
- **Finding**: Using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) down to 20 K, the researchers directly imaged the low-temperature polar structure of SrTiO$_3$. High-resolution imaging revealed a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains with finite polarization. These short-range polar domains initially grow and self-organize into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers, but then fragment into small clusters when entering the quantum paraelectric regime below 40 K, providing unprecedented real-space insights into this quantum material.

**10. [Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269v1)**
- **Authors**: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman
- **Date**: 2025-09-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the viability of image reconstruction in position-blind ptychography, where scan positions are unknown and must be recovered jointly with the image.
- **Finding**: The study explores the challenging problem of position-blind ptychography, a technique analogous to electron ptychography in STEM, by simulating a 2D variant. Using variational inference with score-based diffusion models as data-driven image priors, they found that reliable and successful image reconstructions are achievable even under measurement noise, provided the illumination structure is appropriate and a strong prior is used. This work demonstrates that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in synthetic aperture imaging systems, potentially improving resolution in various imaging modalities.

Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers, specifically to determine if it stems from altermagnetism in RuO$_2$ or other interfacial phenomena.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that the observed exchange bias (EB) behavior in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers is not due to altermagnetism in RuO$_2$ but rather to the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing Fe$_3$O$_4$. This interlayer undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperatures. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize the interface and confirm the presence of this iron oxide interlayer, providing crucial structural evidence for the non-altermagnetic origin of EB.

- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten in air and the sublimation of tungsten oxide to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
- **Finding**: The study investigated the oxidation of pure W at various temperatures and durations, observing void and crack formation above 600°C, leading to dust or oxide spalling. Characterization using electron microscopy (likely scanning electron microscopy for morphology and cross-section analysis) revealed that the oxide scale consists of three main layers: an inner 30-50 nm WO$_2$ layer, a middle 10-20 $\mu$m WO$_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer WO$_{2.9}$/WO$_3$ layer. This detailed microstructural analysis is crucial for understanding parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its implications for tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency in fusion power plants.

**14. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that can overcome the limitations of speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging and exploit speckle to improve resolution.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that speckle noise is a significant challenge for light-based SA systems, proving that SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes is fundamentally impossible with sequential measurements suffering from per-measurement-independent speckle. They developed a snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome this limitation. Remarkably, simulations show that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, thereby improving resolution, a principle that could be relevant for computational imaging in electron microscopy.

Atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the formation of 2D InSe. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional STEM was crucial in revealing an epitaxial alignment of InSe with the sapphire substrate, mediated by a specific interface reconstruction. Samples grown under optimized conditions exhibited strong optical absorption and comparably high electron mobility, highlighting the potential of MOCVD-grown InSe for future applications.

**16. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_2$ at ambient conditions.
- **Finding**: The study used scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, alongside single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD), to investigate the structural properties of UTe$_2$ single crystals. While highly ordered crystalline lattices consistent with the $Immm$ structure were observed, STEM revealed tiny amounts of interstitial defects on the Te$_2$ layers that host Te chains along the b axis. These defects are argued to cause slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are sufficient to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state, highlighting the critical role of minimal structural disorder.

It demonstrates the achievement of sub-5 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV, showcasing its high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms. While this paper focuses on X-ray ptychography, the technique is analogous to electron ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy, where computational methods are used to reconstruct high-resolution images from diffraction patterns.

- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate imaging strategies for characterizing the structure of both stained and unstained 3D DNA origami nanostructures using transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study systematically evaluated different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) for imaging DNA origami. STEM consistently delivered the highest contrast, with optimal performance observed at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate and palladium, which also helped preserve structural integrity. These results establish STEM, particularly HAADF-STEM, as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami, even for unstained samples, providing practical guidelines for reliable structural visualization.

- **Objective**: To directly measure the ultrafast dynamics and phase-space correlations of optical singularity ensembles, particularly focusing on their superluminal velocities.
- **Finding**: The researchers directly measured the ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles, revealing that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities before annihilation, with velocities exceeding the speed of light. These superluminal velocities were amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes. The findings were enabled by combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, allowing for unprecedented probing of topological defect dynamics.

- **Finding**: The study developed four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, enabling direct tracking of 3D atomic rearrangements in individual bimetallic nanocatalysts (Pd-Pt) throughout electrocatalytic cycles. This advanced electron microscopy technique captured two stages of evolution: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, which were corroborated by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) voltage-dependent behaviors. The method identified chemical short-range order at the atomic level and revealed anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations, highlighting the importance of 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions for rational nanocatalyst design.

- **Objective**: To elucidate the influence of water and carbon dioxide concentrations in the plating solution on the quality and deposition yields of terbium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: The study investigated the impact of water and CO$_2$ on terbium thin films produced by Molecular Plating. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the morphology of the thin films, revealing that water concentrations exceeding 1 vol.-% negatively affect film quality. The presence of CO$_2$ led to increased carbonate content, which also negatively influenced film quality. Chemical analysis confirmed the formation of hydroxides, oxides, and carbonates, providing insights into how environmental factors during deposition affect the film microstructure and properties.

**22. [Melting point depression of charge density wave in 1T-TiSe$_2$ due to size effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16730v1)**
- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To observe and understand the size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes using in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study used in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperature down to 20 K to observe size-dependent nucleation and melting of CDWs in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes. They found a melting point depression of the CDW for flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. For very small flakes, the absence of CDWs was observed, consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau model where the finite flake size cuts off the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition. This demonstrates that an electronic phase transition can follow classical nucleation theory due to nanoscale confinement effects, with electron microscopy providing direct visualization.

- **Objective**: To develop and validate a digital correction method for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images to accurately estimate true surface pore size and porosity in nanoporous membranes, accounting for imaging artifacts.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that conventional SEM imaging parameters (high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings) lead to significant underestimations of porosity and pore size in nanoporous membranes. They developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation to estimate the pore structure of uncoated membranes from SEM images. This method yielded significantly higher porosities (3-fold) and larger mean pore diameters (1.5-2-fold) compared to coated samples, and these dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data, highlighting the critical need for improved SEM analysis protocols.

- **Finding**: The study revealed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer, QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer during operation. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was critical in observing that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. These findings established causal relationships between morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and device instability, leading to an encapsulation treatment that dramatically improves lifetime.
