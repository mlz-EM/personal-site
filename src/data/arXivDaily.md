**31. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part II - COMSOL Simulation and Apparatus Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03821v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Investigate, via finite element modeling (FEM) and experimental validation, the mechanism of irregular crystallization in ZBLAN glass caused by intermittent thermal contact loss under vibration (Part II).

Subsequent experiments using a redesigned apparatus showed that even subtle vibration ($\sim 50$ Hz) promotes the transformation of partially crystallized ZBLAN, and higher frequencies ($\sim 100$ Hz) accelerate nucleation. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses confirmed the formation of well-developed crystalline structures and incipient phases at lower temperatures ($330^{\circ}\text{C}$) under vibration.

- **Objective**: Demonstrate the limitations of Annular Dark-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (ADF-STEM) in identifying atomic defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) due to stacking and residual aberrations.
- **Finding**: STEM image simulations and experiments show that intensity differences between B- and N-dominated columns, or C substitutions, become indistinguishable in hBN flakes thicker than 17 atomic layers ($\text{ca. } 6$ nm). Furthermore, the study demonstrated that residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can artificially distort STEM contrast, leading to potential misidentification of atomic defects in multilayer hBN.

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the role of nanoscale structural peculiarities in the antiferromagnetic layered semimetal $\text{EuSn}_{2}\text{As}_{2}$ in generating its puzzling magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) revealed the presence of planar defects corresponding to a distinct $\text{EuSnAs}_{2}$ phase. Microstructural and DFT analysis demonstrated that the reduced distance between Eu layers within these nano-defects promotes local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering. These planar defects collectively form a weak FM phase within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) host, explaining the nonlinear magnetization and ferromagnetic-type hysteresis observed at low fields.

- **Authors**: Vivek Devulapalli, Fedor F. Klimashin, Manuel Bärtschi, Stephan Waldner, Silvia Schwyn Thöny, Johann Michler, Xavier Maeder
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: Examine the nanoindentation hardness and deformation behavior of amorphous/amorphous $\text{Ta}_{2}\text{O}_{5}/\text{SiO}_{2}$ nanolaminates as a function of bilayer thickness.

- **Objective**: Investigate the influence of AlN buffer thickness on the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of $\text{AlGaN}/\text{GaN}$ High-Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) grown on SiC substrates.
- **Finding**: X-ray diffraction and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) revealed that thin AlN buffers (120 nm) are smooth but strained, while thicker single layers (550 nm) exhibit increased surface roughness. Multi-layer buffers up to $2 \mu\text{m}$ maintained surface integrity while alleviating strain. Electron mobility decreased with increasing interface roughness (confirmed by AFM), highlighting the critical trade-off between structural quality and thermal conductivity (which increased with thickness).
