- **Authors**: N. V. Porokhov, M. A. Dryazgov, A. R. Shevchenko, A. M. Mumlyakov, Z. S. Enbaev, Yu. V. Blinova, D. I. Devyaterikov, Yu. P. Korneeva, A. A. Korneev, M. A. Tarkhov
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: Investigate the effect of a scandium nitride ($\text{ScN}$) buffer layer on the superconducting properties, specifically the critical temperature ($T_c$) and resistivity, of niobium nitride ($\text{NbN}$) thin films.
- **Finding**: The use of an $\text{ScN}$ buffer layer significantly enhanced the superconducting characteristics of 29 nm thick $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing $T_c$ from 9 K to 12.5 K and decreasing resistivity. These improvements are attributed to better lattice matching between $\text{NbN}$ and $\text{ScN}$, resulting in a higher quality $\text{NbN}$ crystal lattice, which was confirmed by **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** and X-ray diffraction data.

- **Authors**: Komal Singh, Jyoti Sindkar, Mrunal Ramdasi, Vrishali Jadhav, Rohidas B. Kale
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: Synthesize tin dioxide ($\text{SnO}_2$) nanoparticles using the hydrothermal method and examine how the choice of surfactant affects their structural, morphological, and photocatalytic characteristics for Methylene Blue degradation.
- **Finding**: X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of a highly crystalline tetragonal rutile $\text{SnO}_2$ phase. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** was used to examine the morphology, showing that higher precursor concentrations led to aggregation due to smaller nanoparticle size. The findings demonstrate that surfactant choice critically impacts the crystallinity, size, and shape of $\text{SnO}_2$ nanoparticles, with the PEG-containing sample showing the best photocatalytic performance.

**3. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: Report a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in the classic ferroelectric optical materials $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ at room temperature and determine its physical origin.

- **Authors**: A. A. Shiryaev, E. F. Vasilev, A. L. Vasilev, V. V. Artemov, N. V. Gubanov, D. A. Zedgenizov
- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: Investigate the spatial distribution of nitrogen-related defects and the microstructure of a natural Ib-IaA diamond crystal containing Y-defects.
- **Finding**: Spectroscopy revealed an anticorrelation between nitrogen-related A and C centers and the infrared absorption intensity. **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** revealed the presence of dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects generated by non-conservative dislocation motion. Extended defects, identified as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) up to 20 nm in size, were observed, and their internal walls are suggested to be responsible for the unusual temporal variations (blinking) of the photoluminescence lines observed upon laser excitation.

- **Objective**: Develop a multifunctional, self-sensing implant material ($\text{AuNC-Ti}$) that acts as a nanoengineered surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate to monitor tissue-material interactions noninvasively and in a multiplexed manner.
- **Finding**: $\text{AuNC-Ti}$ SERS substrates were fabricated using oblique angle deposition. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** confirmed the uniform formation of gold nano-columns ($360 \pm 40$ nm long and $50 \pm 16$ nm wide). The material demonstrated high biocompatibility and a high SERS enhancement factor ($1.8 \times 10^5$), enabling spatial identification of porcine tissue components using confocal Raman imaging, promising non-invasive monitoring of implant-tissue interaction.

**7. [Thermal and Size Effects in Ferroelastic Domains by Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10629v1)**
- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Investigate the interplay between temperature and thickness (size effects) on the behavior of ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* heating **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** combined with a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach, a distinct relationship was mapped: DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) were mobile near $T_C$ and froze upon cooling, while DWs in the crossover regime (200-300 nm) were nearly static with minimal reconfiguration. These results map the evolution of DWs across thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes, providing insight for domain engineering.

**8. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Conduct direct real-space imaging of ultrasmall nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ crystals using Fresnel Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and analyze the accuracy of chiral discrimination methods at this scale.
- **Finding**: **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** in Fresnel mode revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon when conventional analysis relying on static bright-dark contrast was applied. Systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations attributed this chiral misinterpretation to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function, establishing quantitative limitations for conventional Fresnel contrast analysis when imaging ultrasmall skyrmions.

**9. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet to determine the true origin of its observed Hall-resistivity anomalies.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they showed little correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, distinguishing them from the topological Hall effect. Most importantly, additional **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** measurements were performed, which definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. The anomalies were thus attributed to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels stemming from sample inhomogeneity, urging caution in using transport measurements alone to identify chiral spin textures.

**10. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: Propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) that eliminates the need for object-specific constraints, addressing the instability and ill-posedness of traditional reconstruction methods.
- **Finding**: CDIP combines untrained coordinate-based neural fields with a physics-consistent forward model, demonstrating substantial superiority over classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability for both static and dynamic reconstructions. This framework provides a paradigm shift for coherent imaging modalities, including those utilizing electron probes, by offering a constraint-free approach to phase retrieval.

- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: Establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings, integrating analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and experimental validation.
- **Finding**: Simulations predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, driving the system toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitating rupture at critical strain levels. *In situ* **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** experiments on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary control mechanism.

**12. [Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09067v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: Investigate and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models used for High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) imaging, focusing on shifts in imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: By testing over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data, the study demonstrated that network performance remains stable but smoothly and predictably worsens as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. A framework utilizing the HRTEM **contrast transfer function (CTF)** was developed to compare information content and quantify OOD domain shifts, providing a crucial tool for understanding and predicting neural network deployment success in experimental **HRTEM** workflows.

**13. [Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07285v1)**
- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: Explore the critical influence of lattice distortion, specifically compressive strain, on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_u$) and magnetization of ($\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x$)$_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys.
- **Finding**: **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** analysis of fabricated $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys revealed compressive strain up to 25% near grain boundaries. First-principles calculations showed that while $K_u$ is positive (4.2 $\text{MJ/m}^3$) under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain. This confirms that lattice distortions, as visualized by STEM, critically influence magnetic properties and must be accounted for in the design of advanced magnetic materials.

- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: Provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of optically active, photoluminescent color centers within meteoritic lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond).
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable photoluminescence peaking at $\sim 700$ nm with an excited-state lifetime of 14 ns. **Correlative electron microscopy** was used to confirm the lonsdaleite host lattice structure. Compositional analysis suggested N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents, indicating that hexagonal-diamond color centers may form a new, unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters.

- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: Manipulate and observe the spatial evolution of helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress to understand the role of magnetic defects in this process.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)**, the reorientation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) was observed, where magnetic defects mediated the process via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" mechanisms, analogous to plastic deformation in metals. Simulations confirmed that strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) likely plays a key role, advancing strain-driven magnetism for energy-efficient nanophase control.

**16. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: Systematically study the formation and characteristics of surface spirals (SS) emerging at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) in chiral magnets, focusing on the influence of the conical phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that $\phi_0$ controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of SSs at 1D and 2D FCIs. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed that eyebrow-like SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, revealing formation pathways via thermal co-growth and field-driven transformation. These results establish $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, enabling potential multi-state spintronic functionalities.

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: Resolve the thermodynamic paradox concerning the synthesis and stability of the metastable solid-state electrolyte $\alpha-\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ by constructing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: Computational and experimental data showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to its low surface energy, drastically lowering the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and **electron microscopy**, which captured the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation, providing a generalizable framework for targeted synthesis of metastable materials.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: Achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity in epitaxial nickelate thin films with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) exceeding 60 K.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset at $\sim 63$ K was achieved in epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium growth method (GAE). **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity and the successful stabilization of the inherently metastable strained phase. The enhanced superconductivity was linked to strange-metal-like behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$), identifying nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-$T_c$ system with significantly stronger interlayer coupling than cuprates.

- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) denoising pipeline for time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images to address low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and ensure excellent out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.
- **Finding**: The proposed pipeline, utilizing a blind-spot convolution neural network, significantly outperformed other methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features in **HRTEM** images. The model demonstrated excellent OOD generalization and a computational inference speed in the order of milliseconds per image, making it fast enough for real-time application in *in situ* **HRTEM** experiments.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2-\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and resolve the boundaries between bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive characterization suite, including X-ray diffraction and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction**, was critical for quantifying crystal structure at multiple length scales and identifying boundaries between closely related phases. The study demonstrated that kinetic energy quenching in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase even with a highly vacated oxygen sublattice (16.7% vacancies), providing guidelines for targeted phase synthesis in HEOs.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ through interfacial engineering by stacking it with various perovskite oxides ($\text{LaTiO}_3$, $\text{LaMnO}_3$, $\text{LaAlO}_3$, and $\text{LaNiO}_3$).
- **Finding**: X-ray absorption spectroscopy identified successful tuning of the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy from partial $d^7$ to partial $d^5$ depending on the interface material, with a $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer layer resulting in a Co $d^6$ low spin state. High-resolution **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** imaging revealed a clear connection between the interfacial strain state and the resulting spin configuration, confirming that interfacial engineering simultaneously governs both orbital occupancy and spin state.

- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Synthesize and characterize a new class of hexagonal Germanium-Tin ($\text{GeSn}$) solid solutions using high-pressure and high-temperature methods.
- **Finding**: Subjecting Ge and Sn to high pressures (9–10 GPa) resulted in the ambient pressure recovery of novel hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H $\text{GeSn}$ solid solutions ($P6_3/mmc$). **Precession electron diffraction** and chemical analysis using **electron microscopy** confirmed the hexagonal symmetry, which is accessible below 21 atom % Sn. This work establishes a new route to tune properties based on crystal symmetry, composition, and stacking sequence for optoelectronic applications.

- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Investigate the quantitative correlations between multiscale microstructural evolution induced by aging heat treatments and the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical performance of 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by PBF-LB.
- **Finding**: PBF-LB specimens exhibited high tensile strength but significantly lower impact toughness than conventional counterparts. Multiscale characterization using **scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM)** identified $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions, originating from the powder, as detrimental nucleation sites for micro-cavities. TEM analysis also revealed that the distribution of Cu-rich nanoprecipitates, tailored by heat treatment, forced a pronounced strength-toughness trade-off.

**24. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic measurements using segmented-detector differential phase contrast (DPC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations showed that DPC-**STEM** measurements are highly sensitive to instrumental configuration. Defocus introduced significant underestimation of the electrostatic field magnitude (e.g., up to 30% for a 30 mrad probe). Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations exceeding 40% for small magnitudes, confirming the high sensitivity and usefulness of the scattergram-based method while underscoring the critical need for optimized instrumental alignment for accurate CoM-based **STEM** imaging.

Comprehensive characterization, including electron microscopy, confirmed the formation of continuous, uniform monolayer graphene. Notably, low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of the graphene/$\text{SrTiO}_3$ heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena such as substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To improve the quality of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite films on textured silicon bottom cells using a $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer to achieve high-efficiency monolithic tandem solar cells.
- **Finding**: A $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer was found to homogenize perovskite growth on unevenly covered textured surfaces by fostering organic precursor incorporation, thereby preventing the formation of residual $\text{PbI}_2$ at the buried interface and leading to larger apparent grains. X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) were crucial in revealing the mechanism of improved precursor incorporation across the interface, resulting in a certified tandem solar cell efficiency of $29.7\%$.

- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize a new class of crystalline interfaces, termed e-coherent, where local non-affine transformations introduce additional coincidence sites via unique line defects called discohesions.
- **Finding**: E-coherency, achieved through non-affine relaxations, introduces line defects called discohesions (topologically equivalent to disconnection dipoles) that alter the state of coherency. Atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content, leading to fundamentally different behaviors compared to non-e-coherent interfaces in grain, twin, and phase boundaries.

**31. [Detecting Linear Dichroism with Atomic Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18796v1)**
- **Authors**: Roger Guzman, Ján Rusz, Ang Li, Juan Carlos Idrobo, Wu Zhou, Jaume Gazquez
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce a versatile electron linear dichroism methodology in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to achieve atomic-scale investigation of electronic anisotropies and orbital polarization.
- **Finding**: By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) within STEM, the methodology allows direct visualization of orbital occupation at individual atomic columns. Using strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_3$ thin films, the $\text{Mn}-3d$ $e_g$ orbital polarization was resolved with sub-angstrom precision, confirming that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^2-r^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^2-y^2$. This approach achieves the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity.

- **Authors**: Ana Senkić, Rachael Keneipp, Petra Ivatović, Namrata Pradeep, Vincent Meunier, Marko Kralj, Marija Drndić, Nataša Vujičić
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and investigate a tungsten (W) doping-induced structural phase transition between semiconducting polytypes in bilayer ($\text{2L}$) $\text{MoS}_2$ synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
- **Finding**: W doping induces a phase transition from non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to centrosymmetric $\text{AB}'$ stacking in $\text{2L}~\text{MoS}_2$, correlated with increasing W concentration. Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) was utilized to demonstrate the spatial distribution of W concentration and the associated structural changes, confirming the efficacy of W-doping as a strategy for inducing structural phase transitions in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for accurately determining the twist angles in artificially stacked cuprate ($\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$) heterostructures.
- **Finding**: A non-invasive method utilizing polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy was developed to identify clear optical fingerprints of rotational misalignment by analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational modes. This approach is advantageous because the twisted interface is highly vulnerable to damage from conventional characterization tools such as electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques, providing a reliable alternative for characterizing this critical parameter.

**34. [The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16474v1)**
- **Authors**: Qiao Wang, Ping-An Hu
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To discover and elucidate the high plasticity in the ternary germanium-based single-crystal van der Waals material $\text{GaGeTe}$.
- **Finding**: $\text{GaGeTe}$ exhibits high plasticity, overcoming the inherent brittleness of traditional germanium-based chalcogenides. Spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) experiments, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealed a novel deformation mechanism co-dominated by intralayer lattice distortion and interlayer slip, providing fresh insight into the plastic behavior of inorganic semiconductors.

- **Authors**: Neil Mulcahy, Syeda Ramin Jannat, Yaqi Li, Tigran Simonian, Mariana Palos, James O. Douglas, Jessica M. Walker, Baptiste Gault, Mary P. Ryan, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To provide a mechanistic understanding of phase transformations and interfacial chemistry in Pt-based alloying anodes across length scales using a correlative *operando* and cryogenic microscopy framework.
- **Finding**: Lithiation proceeds via a solid solution reaction mechanism, forming $\text{Li}_2\text{Pt}$ initially, which evolves to stable $\text{LiPt}$. Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) transitions from unstable carbonate-rich to stable $\text{LiF}$-dominated composition. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography (APT) revealed a nanoscale compositional gradient (lithium flux limited interface to homogeneous $\text{LiPt}$ bulk), rationalizing the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism.

- **Authors**: Qian Chen, Shuoshuo Zhang, Guoyu Xian, Haoqiang Hu, Xiaohua Wu, Xiaofei Wu, Jer-Shing Huang, Chen-Bin Huang, Jin-Hui Zhong, Yuquan Zhang, Xiaocong Yuan, Changjun Min, Yanan Dai
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To generate and directly image synthetic spatiotemporal plasmonic vortices (STPVs) carrying nontrivial topological spin textures using chronotopic interference.
- **Finding**: STPVs were generated by interfering temporally delayed plasmonic eigen-vortices, where a $\pi$-phase dislocation in the space-frequency domain maps into a $2\pi$ spiraling phase in space-time. Interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM) was used to directly image their nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution and control their vortex number and position, establishing STPVs as a platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter.

- **Finding**: $\text{BiPt}$ is established as a weak type-II superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) of $1.2~\text{K}$. It exhibits conventional $s$-wave superconductivity that maintains time-reversal symmetry and pronounced anisotropic characteristics due to its hexagonal structure. Electron microscopy was included in the comprehensive suite of techniques used to confirm the high quality and structure of the single crystals.

- **Authors**: Zahra Teimouri, Mahtab Masouminia, Ashkan Irannezhad, Reza Eslami, Joseph Deering, Navid Noor, Shunquan Tan, Amirhossein Foroozan, Shayan Angizi, Sung-Fu Hun, Drew Higgins
- **Date**: 2025-11-19
- **Objective**: To develop a stable and efficient atomically dispersed $\text{Ni}-\text{N}-\text{C}$ catalyst integrated into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for $\text{CO}_2$ reduction ($\text{CO}_2\text{R}$) to CO.
- **Finding**: The $\text{Ni}-\text{NCNT}$ catalyst (supported on carbon nanotubes) achieved a high partial current density of $558~\text{mA}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ toward CO and demonstrated stable operation at $100~\text{mA}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ over 210 hours. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography was critical, providing 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers. Simulations based on the FIB-SEM data demonstrated that the superior performance is due to improved $\text{CO}_2$ diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution enabled by the NCNT support.

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To propose an analytical physical model for secondary electron (SE) topographical contrast formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to move beyond empirical interpretation.
- **Finding**: An analytical physical model was developed that accurately accounts for the physics of SE emission and their interaction with the magnetic field in the TEM objective lens. This model enables more reliable interpretation of surface-sensitive, pseudo-3D topographic information obtained from STEM-SE imaging, laying the groundwork for novel 3D surface reconstruction algorithms.

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{N}$ thin films, focusing on the influence of Ge doping and structural anisotropy.
- **Finding**: The tetragonal samples ($x=0.8$ and $1$) display unusual two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects hysteresis loops. Electron microscopy confirmed the structural transition from cubic $\text{Fe}_4\text{N}$ to a tetragonal phase for $x>0.35$. This two-component behavior is attributed to the coexistence of two crystallographic orientations (c-axis and a-axis normal to the film surface) combined with opposite signs of the anomalous effects for magnetization along the $a$ and $c$ axes.

- **Authors**: Anand Ithepalli, Saumya Vashishtha, Naomi Pieczulewski, Qiao Liu, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Matthew Barone, Darrell Schlom, David A. Muller, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Objective**: To investigate how the miscut angle of c-plane sapphire substrates affects the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting properties of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown $\text{NbN}$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle from $0.5^\text{o}$ to $10^\text{o}$ significantly improved the structural quality of the $\text{NbN}$ films, leading to a marginal increase in superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) from $12.1~\text{K}$ to $12.5~\text{K}$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were crucial in determining that the $\text{NbN}$ films exhibit a critical thickness of approximately $10~\text{nm}$, above which columnar growth begins, regardless of the substrate miscut angle.

- **Authors**: Alinda Ezgi Gerçek, Till Korten, Paul Chekhonin, Maleeha Hassan, Peter Steinbach
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To develop a data-efficient deep learning pipeline using a lightweight U-Net for the rapid and accurate segmentation of carbide precipitates in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of steel alloys.
- **Finding**: A lightweight U-Net model trained on only 10 annotated SEM images achieved a Dice-Sørensen coefficient of $0.98$ for carbide segmentation in reactor-pressure-vessel steel. This significantly outperformed classical image analysis ($0.85$) and demonstrated that data-efficient deep learning can automate carbide quantification in metallurgy, despite the gray-value overlap between carbides and the matrix in SEM images.

- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism by which increasing V content in $\text{Nb}-\text{Ta}-\text{Ti}-\text{V}$ refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) drives a transition in dislocation glide control, enhancing high-temperature strength.
- **Finding**: Increasing V content induces substantial atomic misfit, which raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual mechanistic transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was integrated with mechanical testing and molecular dynamics simulations to confirm and characterize the resulting dislocation structures.

- **Authors**: Varatharaja Nallathambi, Aneeta Jose Puthussery, Andrea M. Mingers, Robert Stuckert, André Olean-Oliveira, Sven Reichenberger, Dierk Raabe, Viktor Čolić, Baptiste Gault, Stephan Barcikowski
- **Date**: 2025-11-12
- **Objective**: To strategically utilize the phase metastability of laser-synthesized, carbon-doped Cantor alloy-based high-entropy nanoalloys through post-synthesis annealing to enhance electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
- **Finding**: The metastable amorphous nanoalloys undergo crystallization and elemental partitioning upon heating to $600^\text{o}\text{C}$, forming heterostructured nanoparticles with reinforced carbon shells. *In situ* electron microscopy was used to directly observe this crystallization and partitioning process, which resulted in a 5- to 7-fold enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity for the OER compared to the as-synthesized counterparts.

The $\omega$ solvus temperature was determined to be approximately $555^\text{o}\text{C}$.

- **Authors**: Annett Thøgersen, Georg Muntingh, Lasse Vines, Øystein Prytz, Max Kneiß, Marius Grundmann, Holger von Wenckstern, Ingvild J. T. Jensen
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To resolve band gap variations and decouple the influence of composition and interfacial strain across $\kappa$-$\text{Ga}_2\text{O}_3$-based multilayers with nanometer-scale precision.
- **Finding**: Monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) was used to reliably extract band gap excitations from layers only a few nanometers thick. For heterostructures grown on ITO, STEM-EELS revealed that strain at defect-free interfaces induces a gradual band gap transition (from $5.08~\text{eV}$ to $4.28~\text{eV}$ over $\sim 10~\text{nm}$) despite an abrupt compositional change, highlighting the dominant role of interfacial strain in governing local band structure.

This approach successfully reconstructed the 3D coordinates of vacancies across hundreds of thousands of lattice sites, generating robust statistical insight. This data allowed for the classification of a hierarchy of defect structures—from isolated vacancies to nanopores—providing a generalizable framework for understanding and controlling point defects across large volumes in 2D materials.
