**1. [Single photon emitters in hBN: Limitations of atomic resolution imaging and potential sources of error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03674v1)**
- **Authors**: David Lamprecht, Shrirang Chokappa, Alissa M. Freilinger, Barbara Maria Mayer, Maximilian Melchior, Jana Dzíbelová, Darwin Lorber, Luiz H. G. Tizei, Mathieu Kociak, Clemens Mangler, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the limitations of atomic-resolution imaging, specifically annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM), for identifying single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), particularly concerning sample thickness and common aberrations.
- **Finding**: STEM image simulations and experiments demonstrate that intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic layers (ca. 6 nm). While vacancy-type defects can remain detectable at somewhat larger thicknesses, their detection also becomes unreliable at thicknesses typically used in photonic studies. Electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) further revealed that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial contrast differences between columns, potentially resulting in misidentification of atomic defects.

- **Authors**: Ilia Zykov, Guido Stam, Hanieh Jafarian, Amin Moradi, Peter Neu, Rudolf Tromp, Mariana Amaro, Thomas Juffmann, Sense van der Molen
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Introduce and demonstrate Optical Near-field Electron Microscopy (ONEM) as a non-invasive, label-free imaging technique combining high spatial and temporal resolution for bio- and materials science.

This electron microscopy technique achieves $31$ nm spatial and sub-second temporal resolution without exposing the sample to electrons, preserving structural and functional integrity. ONEM was successfully demonstrated for imaging polarization-dependent plasmon modes in metal nanostructures, visualizing live *Escherichia coli* in liquid, and capturing real-time electrodeposition of copper nanoclusters from solution.

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the nano-scale structural peculiarities in the antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and explain their role in its puzzling magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed the presence of planar defects in the lattice of EuSn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single crystals. Using a combination of microstructural and DFT analysis, it was demonstrated that a single planar nano-defect forms a layer of a distinct EuSnAs$_{2}$ phase, where the smaller distance between Eu layers promotes local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of Eu atoms. Electron microscopy thus provided crucial insights into how these planar defects form a weak ferromagnetic phase within the antiferromagnetic host lattice, explaining several puzzling magnetic features.

- **Finding**: A method leveraging three-dimensional structures reconstructed from multislice electron ptychography was developed, achieving atomic-scale precision in mapping surface roughness and interfacial imperfection. This electron microscopy technique allows for counting the number of atoms, including light elements such as oxygen, along the electron trajectory, leading to the identification of surface termination in oxide films. The planar-view measurement geometry provides rich information and high statistics about atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities in freestanding membranes.

- **Authors**: M. G. Masteghin, Z. P. Aslam, A. P. Brown, M. J. Whiting, S. K. Clowes, R. P. Webb, D. C. Cox
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: Quantify the full damage profile, including the often-overlooked beam tail, of focused ion beams (FIBs) at low defect densities using 4D-STEM precession electron diffraction and PSNR metrics.
- **Finding**: Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) was used to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<0.1$ ions nm$^{-2}$. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns, collected and compared using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artifacts than conventional dark-field imaging. This electron microscopy approach enables a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB performance.

**8. [Interface-mediated softening and deformation mechanics in amorphous/ amorphous nanolaminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00213v1)**
- **Authors**: Vivek Devulapalli, Fedor F. Klimashin, Manuel Bärtschi, Stephan Waldner, Silvia Schwyn Thöny, Johann Michler, Xavier Maeder
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: Examine the nanoindentation hardness and deformation behavior of amorphous-amorphous Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$/SiO$_{2}$ nanolaminates with bilayer thicknesses ranging from $2$ nm to $334$ nm.
- **Finding**: Hardness decreased with reduced bilayer thickness, contrasting with crystalline systems which typically strengthen. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that fine bilayer spacings promoted closely spaced vertical shear bands with bilayer compression, while coarser spacings showed fewer, widely spaced shear bands with chemical intermixing. Scanning electron diffraction mapping further demonstrated significant densification beneath indents, indicating that high interface density facilitates strain accommodation and prevents catastrophic failure typical of brittle amorphous materials.

- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: Present a novel, ligand-free approach for synthesizing organic-inorganic (MAPbX$_{3}$) and all-inorganic lead-free double perovskite (Cs$_{2}$AgBiX$_{6}$) nanocrystals (NCs) using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in ambient air.
- **Finding**: High-purity, ligand-free perovskite NCs with average sizes up to $100$ nm were successfully synthesized. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction confirmed the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX$_{3}$ forming larger ($\approx 90$ nm) cubic NCs and Cs$_{2}$AgBiX$_{6}$ forming smaller ($\approx 10$ nm) rounded NCs. Photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed pronounced size-dependent blue shifts ($17-40$ nm) due to quantum confinement, particularly for Br and I containing perovskites.

- **Authors**: Xiliang Yang, Tetsuo Martynowicz, Allard Katan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Sabina Caneva
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Objective**: Demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy.
- **Finding**: Thermally induced wrinkles in hBN were shown to form scalable and reproducible nanochannel networks whose densities and morphologies can be tuned. Structural characterization using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained within the nanochannels. Selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in these one-dimensional channels were achieved through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure, where graphene suppressed background fluorescence.

**11. [Incoherent dielectric tensor tomography for quantitative 3D measurement of biaxial anisotropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26348v1)**
- **Authors**: Juheon Lee, Yeon Wook Kim, Hwanseok Chang, Herve Hugonnet, Seung-Mo Hong, Seokwoo Jeon, YongKeun Park
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Objective**: Introduce incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT), a non-interferometric optical imaging method, for quantitatively reconstructing the 3D dielectric tensor and measuring biaxial anisotropy.
- **Finding**: iDTT achieves speckle-free and vibration-robust mapping of biaxial birefringence with submicron resolution by combining polarization diversity and angular-spectrum modulation. Unlike X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, iDTT provides full three-dimensional (3D) information without specialized facilities or destructive preparation. Applied to mixed and polycrystalline materials, iDTT distinguishes crystal types by their birefringent properties and reveals 3D grain orientations and boundaries, establishing it as a practical and accessible tool for quantitative, label-free characterization.

**12. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part I -- Experimental Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25748v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley, Ujjwal Dhakal
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Objective**: Systematically investigate the influence of mechanical vibration on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN glass under controlled thermal conditions.
- **Finding**: Vibration was found to reduce the crystallization onset temperature, indicating enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed progressive morphological transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Surface roughness analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale roughness in crystallized regions, confirming that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation.

- **Authors**: Antonin Louiset, Daniel Förster, Vincent Jourdain, Saïd Tahir, Nicola Vigano, Jean-Luc Rouvière, Christophe Bichara, Hanako Okuno
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in the structural analysis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), including chirality, strain distribution, and atomic defects.
- **Finding**: 4D-STEM, using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, enabled precise determination of the local chirality of multiple nanotubes simultaneously, with limited electron dose (down to $1750$ e$^{-}$/{\AA}$^{2}$) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to $3.1$ nm). This electron microscopy approach also allowed tracking chirality along a single nanotube and accessing strain distribution. Furthermore, high-resolution images reconstructed with electron ptychography provided atomic-scale spatial resolution for imaging atomic defects, with multi-slice electron ptychography offering potential for close to 3D imaging capabilities.

**14. [Optimizing probes for multi-beam ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24542v1)**
- **Authors**: Runqing Yang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez, Maik Kahnt
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: Present a quantitative framework to assess and optimize probe sets for multi-beam ptychography (MBP) based on separability, uniformity, and fabrication feasibility, aiming for more robust and scalable reconstructions.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that Hadamard-based binary phase masks consistently outperform other probe designs (Zernike polynomials, experimentally feasible phase plates, and spiral phase masks) across varying scan densities for MBP. While spiral masks yield comparable resolution, their increased structural complexity makes them less efficient. This work establishes practical criteria for evaluating and designing structured probes to enable more robust and scalable implementation of MBP in high-throughput coherent X-ray and EUV imaging, which is relevant for advanced electron ptychography applications.

- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: Develop a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) measurements in transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: The study systematically analyzed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy channels in EMCD measurements on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure and evaluation of detector noise (identifying detector-amplified shot noise as the dominant source) were introduced. This electron microscopy technique (EMCD) framework recommends a stricter SNR threshold for reliable detection and quantification, advancing its reliability as a quantitative tool for magnetic characterization at the nanoscale.

O'Neal, Jumpei Yamada, Taito Osaka, Robert Zierold, Carina Hedrich, Dimitrios Kazazis, Yasin Ekinci, Makina Yabashi, Ichiro Inoue, Andrew Aquila, Meng Liang, Agostino Marinelli, Tais Gorkhover
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: Demonstrate a new approach for lensless 3D imaging of non-periodic specimens using fluorescence intensity correlations, eliminating the need for extensive sample rotation required by conventional coherent diffraction imaging.
- **Finding**: The study showed that intensity correlations of X-ray fluorescence excited by ultrashort X-ray pulses contain 3D structural information of non-periodic, stationary objects. By recording $16$ distinct specimen projections from a single sample orientation using detector regions covering different photon incidence angles, the experiment confirmed that FEL-induced fluorescence reflects real-space structural changes. This establishes a novel lensless 3D imaging method that bypasses the complexities of sample rotation, offering advantages over conventional electron microscopy for thick samples.

**17. [Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moirés](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042v1)**
- **Authors**: Harikrishnan KP, Xin Wei, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Ruijuan Xu, Jong-Hoon Kang, Ce Liang, Jiwoong Park, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Objective**: Investigate the challenges of achieving atomic-level coupling at buried interfaces in twisted oxide moirés, particularly focusing on topographic mismatch due to surface roughness.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of oxide membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches, even after eliminating contaminants. Cross-sectional imaging using electron ptychography reliably resolved structural variations on the order of a nanometer at buried interfaces, outperforming conventional through-focal imaging which was relatively insensitive. This electron microscopy technique highlighted interface roughness as a key challenge for oxide twistronics and emphasized the need for reliable characterization methods.

**18. [Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320v1)**
- **Authors**: Tim Titze, Sabri Koraltan, Timo Schmidt, Mailin Matthies, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Dieter Suess, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil
- **Date**: 2025-10-24
- **Objective**: Investigate the control of bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers through stripe domain engineering using in-plane magnetic fields.
- **Finding**: Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM), magnetic force microscopy (MFM), and micromagnetic simulations revealed that applying a brief in-plane "set" magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. This enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Electron microscopy techniques were crucial in visualizing and understanding these magnetic textures and their transformation.

Leveraging PyTorch, it ensures vendor-agnostic GPU acceleration and multi-device parallelization. While not directly an electron microscopy technique, this software is critical for processing data obtained from electron ptychography, enabling high-resolution imaging in electron microscopy.

- **Finding**: A boron nitride (BN) coating was developed for CR-39 to enhance neutron detection efficiency by converting neutrons into energetic alpha particles through the well-known $^{10}$B(n,$\alpha$)$^{7}$Li reaction. Separate partially coated CR-39 pieces were exposed to AmBe, $^{252}$Cf, and D-T ($14$ MeV) neutron sources and subsequently analyzed under an optical microscope and through large-area scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging over the irradiated area. SEM provided detailed visualization of the tracks, confirming the enhanced detection efficiency.

- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Veronica Leccese, Ján Rusz, Jon Ander Arregi, Alexey Sapozhnik, Jáchym Štindl, Francesco Barantani, Paolo Cattaneo, Antoine Andrieux, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Fabrizio Carbone, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: Systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) analysis for sub-$10$ nm quantification of spin and orbital magnetic moments across the metamagnetic phase transition in FeRh.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that the extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) from EMCD remains consistent with XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately $6$ nm, establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$ was observed, attributed to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity. This electron microscopy technique (EMCD) provides quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments in functional magnetic materials.

**22. [Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517v2)**
- **Authors**: M. J. Adriaans, J. P. Hoogenboom, A. Mohammadi-Gheidari
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: Investigate the design considerations for an electrostatic electron monochromator to enhance energy resolution in electron microscopy and spectroscopy, aiming for a cost-effective and simpler design.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of current monochromators to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections through a thin-deflector analysis. It proposed that a fringe-field deflector is less sensitive to these issues, leading to a cost-effective and simple monochromator design based on pure fringe fields, which does not require extra correcting elements. This fully electrostatic design, potentially realized using MEMS technology, could make electron monochromators more accessible for filtering beam energies in electron microscopy.

- **Authors**: Léon F. Schröder, Sabrina Weber, Lukas Fuchs, Volker Schmidt, Benedikt Prifling
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: Develop a novel approach to predict the 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes from readily available 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, addressing the high cost of conventional 3D imaging.
- **Finding**: The method utilizes a low-parametric 3D stochastic geometry model to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures, then employs a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain corresponding 2D SEM images. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on this dataset, the 3D microstructure can be statistically reconstructed from 2D SEM images. This approach, validated by error analysis on key geometrical descriptors, offers a cost-effective alternative to focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) for 3D characterization.

- **Finding**: The study achieved thickness control at the sub-unit cell scale, alternating $3$, $2$ or $1$ single atomic layers of Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$. X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and Raman spectroscopy confirmed this atomic-scale accuracy and the stabilization of the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_{3}$ (space group R-$3$). STEM was crucial for visualizing and confirming the precise atomic layer arrangement within the superlattice thin films, enabling the engineering of ordered corundum oxides with tailored properties.

- **Objective**: To investigate the planar defect structures in the Ta-Fe $\mu$-phase across a compositional range to understand their influence on material properties.
- **Finding**: The study revealed a transition in planar defect structures from basal twin boundaries and planar faults containing C14 TaFe$_2$ Laves phase layers at low Ta content to pyramidal $\{1\bar{1}02\}$ twins at higher Ta content. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) were crucial in revealing these defect structures and their compositional dependence. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the chemical potential-driven stabilization of Laves phase lamellae, leading to a proposed defect landscape for $\mu$-phases.

- **Finding**: The iEBL platform successfully integrated individual QDs into CBG resonators, achieving high alignment accuracy and a process yield of over 90% across various CBG geometries. A powerful characterization technique combining cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to evaluate QD placement accuracy, demonstrating the scalability and reliability of the approach for high-performance QD-based single-photon sources.

**29. [Structured Random Phase Retrieval using Optical Diffusers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14490v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Hu, Fakhriyya Mammadova, Julián Tachella, Michael Unser, Jonathan Dong
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Objective**: To propose and demonstrate structured random models for phase retrieval that reduce computational costs while maintaining reconstruction performance.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that structured random models, which emulate dense random matrices using a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices, can achieve the same reconstruction performance as dense random models with complexity reduced from quadratic to log-linear. Robust reconstruction was obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8. While phase retrieval is applicable to various imaging modalities including electron microscopy, this paper focuses on the theoretical framework and optical implementation using lenses and diffusers, without describing specific electron microscopy techniques used in its findings.

**30. [Mapping Temperature Using Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14175v2)**
- **Authors**: Yueyun Chen, Xin Yi Ling, Jared Lodico, Tristan P. O`Neill, B. C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Objective**: To demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique, for mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures.
- **Finding**: KDTh, by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns to detect local volumetric lattice changes, achieved a temperature sensitivity of 2.2 K/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and parameter precision of ~0.01%.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated the emergence of magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements were critical in revealing spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers on Cu(100), indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments confirmed this effect was not due to artifacts or chirality-induced spin selectivity. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations attributed the magnetism to strong chemisorption and hybridization, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface.
