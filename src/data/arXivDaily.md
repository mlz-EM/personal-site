**30. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: Systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam scanning trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques, specifically electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography, in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study found that ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position, even with non-raster scan patterns (spiral and multi-pass sequential). In contrast, atomic-resolution *EELS* maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with non-uniform elemental contrast introduced by these alternative scan modes. Spiral scanning under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO$_3$ thin films improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions, highlighting the inherent resilience of ptychography to trajectory-induced artifacts in 4D-STEM.

- **Objective**: Investigate the gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs).
- **Finding**: The observed NDR is attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. *High-resolution electron microscopy (HREM)*, combined with electrical transport measurements, revealed that in-plane electric fields ($V_d$) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moire patterns), and intralayer shear, together producing stress-induced phase transitions. This atomic-scale ex-situ imaging was crucial for understanding the mechanistic insights into the device behavior and the intrinsic limitations of In$_2$Se$_3$ field-effect transistors for conventional ferroelectric memory applications.

- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: Study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS$_2$) nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and explain recent experimental observations.

- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: Clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and fracture mechanisms in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture in the elastic regime. *Fractographic studies* indicated intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology, while *site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations* revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. *Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)* studies on cross-sectional cracks further supported the explanation of HE via a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen diffusion promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocities, leading to $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking. TEM observations also explained the formation of river pattern features.

- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: Investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand dopant self-organization within amorphous interfacial complexions.
- **Finding**: Chemical partitioning was observed for both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries. *High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM)* and *elemental analysis* were used to study these boundaries, revealing that the amorphous-crystalline transition region is enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others. While nanobeam electron diffraction provided qualitative measures, HR-STEM and elemental analysis were crucial for directly observing the chemical patterning, which atomistic simulations then linked to changes in local structural disorder.

- **Authors**: A. Benhadjira, C. Detlefs, S. Borgi, V. Favre-Nicolin, C. Yildirim
- **Date**: 2025-09-05

- **Finding**: The study introduced a deep learning framework using a lightweight convolutional neural network to automate the classification of weak-beam conditions in DFXM. This addresses a critical bottleneck in DFXM, which, like *Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)*, is used for dislocation characterization. While TEM offers atomic-scale resolution, it is limited to thin foils; DFXM provides 3D, non-destructive imaging in bulk. The deep learning approach transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool, enabling statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials.

**46. [Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00943v1)**
- **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
- **Date**: 2025-08-31
- **Objective**: Apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te phase-change materials.
- **Finding**: By applying unsupervised machine learning (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, k-means clustering) to *4D-STEM data*, the study identified four distinct clusters corresponding to variations in composition and structure within Ge-Sb-Te alloys. Elemental intensity histograms and averaged diffraction patterns derived from these clusters confirmed chemical signatures (e.g., oxygen and germanium enrichment) and structural variations. This demonstrates that clustering analysis of 4D-STEM data provides a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in phase-change materials, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.
