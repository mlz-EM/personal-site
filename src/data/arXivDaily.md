**1. [Specimen preparation for atom probe tomography analysis of complex multifunctional nanoparticles and nanostructures: state-of-the-art and challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15629v1)**
- **Authors**: Varatharaja Nallathambi, Se-Ho Kim, Nikita Polin, Natalia F. Shkodich, Sven Reichenberger, Stephan Barcikowski, Baptiste Gault
- **Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Objective**: To review and provide recommendations for specimen preparation protocols, especially using co-electrodeposition, for atom probe tomography (APT) analysis of complex multifunctional nanoparticles and nanostructures, addressing current challenges.
- **Finding**: The paper highlights that while focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) lift-out procedures have advanced atom probe tomography (APT) analysis for multifunctional materials, they are often unsuitable for many nanomaterials. Co-electrodeposition of metallic films is presented as a facilitating method for APT specimen preparation, enabling analysis of various nanomaterials like nanowires and nanoparticles.

**2. [Structured Random Phase Retrieval using Optical Diffusers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14490v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Hu, Fakhriyya Mammadova, Julián Tachella, Michael Unser, Jonathan Dong
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Objective**: To propose and demonstrate structured random models for phase retrieval that reduce computational costs while maintaining reconstruction performance, with direct applicability in optical imaging and other modalities like electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study introduces structured random models for phase retrieval, which emulate dense random matrices using a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices, thereby reducing computational complexity from quadratic to log-linear. It demonstrates that these models achieve comparable reconstruction performance to dense random models, enabling robust reconstruction at low oversampling ratios (as low as 2.8) using a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent. The performance is solely determined by the singular value distribution of the forward matrix, and the models can be implemented with basic optical elements like lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging, including potential applications in electron microscopy.

**3. [Mapping Temperature Using Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14175v1)**
- **Authors**: Yueyun Chen, Xin Yi Ling, Jared Lodico, Tristan P. O`Neill, B. C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Objective**: To demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh) as a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique for mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique, capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures by detecting local volumetric lattice changes through precise fitting of Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Using a 5.5-nm electron probe, they mapped lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite, achieving a parameter precision of $\sim$0.01% and a temperature sensitivity of 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers enhanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, surpassing precision measured in transmission electron microscopy, and can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes.

- **Authors**: Yu-Mi Wu, Sihun Lee, Yufeng Xi, Stephen D. Funni, Saif Siddique, Natalie L. Williams, Giovanni Sartorello, Hesam Askari, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Objective**: To develop a scalable and deterministic method for constructing heterostrain-induced moiré superlattices in 2D materials using patterned thin-film stressors.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates a scalable process to deterministically induce strain in 2D materials, leading to the construction of heterostrain-induced moiré superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenides. By applying patterned thin-film stressors, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial for directly resolving the induced heterostrain, lattice deformations, and stacking variations that form the moiré superlattice. The findings show that uniaxial and biaxial heterostrain produce distinct moiré patterns, including stripes and distorted hexagonal patterns, and enable the creation of in-plane polar distortions and polarization at moiré superlattice domain boundaries in MoS$_2$. This deterministic and scalable approach opens new avenues for designing moiré geometries in 2D materials.

**5. [Surface Properties of Ga-Cu Based Liquid-Metal Alloys: Impact of Cu Dilution Topography and Reaction Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13286v1)**
- **Authors**: Tzung-En Hsieh, Michael S. Moritz, Andreas Mölkner, Christoph Wichmann, Johannes Frisch, Julien Steffen, Caiden J. Parker, Vaishnavi Krishnamurthi, Torben Daeneke, Hans-Peter Steinrück, Andreas Görling, Christian Papp, Marcus Bär
- **Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the surface properties of Ga-Cu based liquid metal alloys, particularly the impact of Cu dilution and reaction conditions, for applications in supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS).
- **Finding**: The study used X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and Machine-Learned-Force Field (ML-FF) calculations to investigate Ga-Cu liquid metal alloys. It found that decreasing Cu content shifts the Cu 2p core level to higher binding energies and narrows the d-band, attributed to site isolation. XPS measurements at elevated temperatures (100 and 500 $^\circ$C) showed a Cu 2p shift to lower binding energies, tentatively linked to bond elongation. Crucially, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images provided evidence for the presence of crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds at low temperatures, explaining the increased Cu surface content. These insights contribute to the development of low-temperature melting liquid metals for heterogeneous catalysis.

- **Finding**: The researchers successfully grew AlScN thin films via MOCVD, achieving controllable scandium (Sc) incorporation up to $\sim$13% as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). AlScN/AlN/GaN heterostructures exhibited the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel at the AlScN/AlN--GaN interface, confirming their potential for HEMT devices, with thicker barriers (e.g., $\sim$30~nm) yielding higher sheet charge densities ($5.22\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$). High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) was instrumental in further confirming Sc incorporation and revealing the wurtzite crystalline structure of both the films and heterostructures. These results establish MOCVD as a promising method for advancing III-nitride heterostructures for high-performance electronics.

- **Finding**: The study successfully synthesized Sm$^{3+}$-doped K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles via a hydrothermal technique, resulting in particles approximately 20 $\mu$m in length. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were used to confirm the orthorhombic crystal structure of the microparticles. A combination of absorption and laser-excited fluorescence spectroscopy performed on samples cooled to 10 K allowed for the determination of 56 experimental crystal-field levels, which were then well-approximated by a parameterized crystal-field analysis for Sm$^{3+}$ in the C$_{\rm s}$ point group symmetry centers of K$_2$YF$_5$.

- **Finding**: The researchers developed a custom Timepix3-compatible scanning unit to leverage the advantages of event-based direct electron detection in electron microscopy, which offers lower noise, reduced point-spread function, and increased quantum efficiency. They demonstrated its performance in enabling spatially and temporally resolved experiments and its seamless integration with other time-resolved instruments like pulsed lasers and electron beam blankers. This advancement addresses limitations of standard scanning units with event-based detectors in continuous-gun scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM), paving the way for enhanced temporal resolution in time-resolved electron microscopy experiments.

**9. [Enhancing the Plasmonic Hotspot Density via Structural Engineering of Multi-layered MoO3-Ag-Au Systems Under Extreme Electronic Excitation Conditions for Ultra-Sensitive SERS Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11470v1)**
- **Authors**: Om Prakash, Sharmistha Dey, Mayur Khan, Abhijith T, Udai Bhan Singh, Ambuj Tripathi, Santanu Ghosh
- **Date**: 2025-10-13
- **Objective**: To enhance the plasmonic hotspot density in multi-layered MoO$_3$-Ag-Au systems for ultra-sensitive Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) applications through ion-beam engineering.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that ion-beam engineering of MoO$_3$-Ag-Au multilayer plasmonic substrates significantly improves SERS performance. Orthorhombic $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ microflakes were fabricated, followed by thermal evaporation of Ag and Au films, and then irradiated with 100 MeV Ag$^{8+}$ swift heavy ions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was crucial in elucidating that irradiation causes dewetting of metal films, leading to the formation of dispersed Ag-Au nanoparticles and enhanced surface roughness, which are essential for creating plasmonic hotspots. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further disclosed vibrational alterations and binding-energy shifts indicative of oxygen vacancies and partial reduction of Mo, all contributing to significantly increased Raman intensities in SERS measurements.

- **Authors**: Yuxuan Chen, Ruotong Yang, Zhengyang Zhang, Mehreen Ahmed, Yanming Wang
- **Date**: 2025-10-13
- **Objective**: To develop a multi-modal, automated, and large-language-model-assisted framework for detecting and extracting scale bar information from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images.
- **Finding**: The researchers propose a four-phase framework for automated scale bar detection and extraction in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images, addressing the current manual and error-prone process. The framework includes an Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model, scale bar object detection, information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system (DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)-based algorithms), and a Large Language Model (LLM) agent for analysis and verification. The model achieved high precision (100%), recall (95.8%), and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% (at IoU=0.5) for object detection. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score, outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, while the LLM acts as a reasoning engine and intelligent assistant. This automated method significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection in SEM images.

- **Date**: 2025-10-13
- **Objective**: To develop and validate an accurate and efficient pixel-wise gain and nonlinearity calibration method for charge-integrating hybrid pixel detectors, specifically the M\"ONCH detector, to improve their performance in X-ray imaging and electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study introduces an improved pixel-wise gain and nonlinearity calibration method for charge-integrating hybrid pixel detectors, such as the M\"ONCH detector (with a 25 \textmu m pixel pitch), using a backside pulsing technique. This method generates a three-dimensional lookup table for all pixels, mapping their response to a calibrated linear energy scale across the full dynamic range. Compared with conventional linear calibration, the proposed method significantly reduces deviations between calibrated and nominal energies, improving energy resolution by 4% to 22% for 15-25 keV photons and 16% to 23% for 60-200 keV electrons. For electron microscopy, deep learning-based electron localization demonstrated a 4% improvement in spatial resolution when using this new calibration, highlighting its crucial role in fully exploiting the subpixel resolution capabilities of these detectors.

- **Objective**: To comprehensively study the molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium selenide (GaSe) on c-plane sapphire substrates and construct its growth mode diagram.
- **Finding**: The researchers conducted a comprehensive study of GaSe growth on 2-inch c-plane sapphire substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. In-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), in-situ Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to construct a growth mode diagram as a function of substrate temperature (530-650 $^\circ$C) and Se/Ga flux ratio (5-110). The diagram revealed distinct growth regimes, including the formation of layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide GaSe with an unstrained in-plane lattice constant of $0.371 \pm 0.001$ nm and a partial epitaxial alignment. This RHEED-based approach offers a pathway for synthesizing GaSe with specific phases and morphologies, and the construction of a phase diagram for high vapor pressure III-VI compounds.

- **Authors**: Damian Brzozowski, Yu Liu, Karola Neeleman, Magnus Nord, Ingrid G. Hallsteinsen
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Objective**: To achieve controlled growth of highly textured Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films on SrTiO$_3$ substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and investigate the influence of growth parameters on film properties.
- **Finding**: The study successfully deposited highly textured Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films on (111) oriented SrTiO$_3$ substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD), demonstrating that careful selection of temperature and pressure allows manipulation of film stoichiometry. Optimized PLD conditions enabled the growth of films with coalesced, faceted grains up to 430 nm, maintaining crystalline quality comparable to molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown films. Crucially, analysis of cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed a sharp, defect-free substrate-film interface without atomic intermixing or the formation of amorphous intermediate layers. Tuning laser pulsing frequency and fluence led to significant differences in surface roughness, porosity, grain boundaries, and grain shape, highlighting PLD as a viable method for producing high-quality Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films and integrating chalcogenides with perovskites.

**14. [$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) surface reconstructions from first principles and experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09233v1)**
- **Authors**: Konstantin Lion, Piero Mazzolini, Kingsley Egbo, Toni Markurt, Oliver Bierwagen, Martin Albrecht, Claudia Draxl
- **Date**: 2025-10-10
- **Objective**: To comprehensively investigate surface reconstructions on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) using a combination of first-principles calculations and experimental observations.
- **Finding**: The study combined first-principles calculations with experimental observations to investigate $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) surface reconstructions. Ab initio atomistic thermodynamics and replica-exchange grand-canonical molecular dynamics simulations revealed several stable reconstructions, most notably a previously unreported 1$\times$2 reconstruction consisting of paired GaO$_4$ tetrahedra, which exhibited remarkable stability across a wide range of experimental growth conditions. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging of homoepitaxially grown (001) layers provided experimental evidence consistent with the predicted 1$\times$2 structure, where two Ga atoms share one oxygen bond and are separated by a distance of \SI{2.64}{\angstrom} along the [010] direction. Further investigations into indium substitution at surface sites revealed cooperative In incorporation with distinct stability regions under O-rich conditions, offering crucial insights for controlling surface properties during epitaxial growth.

**15. [Higher-order epitaxy: A pathway to suppressing structural instability and emergent superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07947v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuki Sato, Soma Nagahama, Shunsuke Kitou, Hajime Sagayama, Ilya Belopolski, Ryutaro Yoshimi, Minoru Kawamura, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Naoya Kanazawa, Takuya Nomoto, Ryotaro Arita, Taka-hisa Arima, Masashi Kawasaki, Yoshinori Tokura
- **Date**: 2025-10-09
- **Objective**: To explore the potential of higher-order epitaxy in controlling material properties, specifically suppressing structural instability and inducing emergent superconductivity in FeTe thin films.
- **Finding**: The researchers demonstrated the growth of single-crystalline FeTe films via 6:5 commensurate higher-order epitaxy on CdTe(001) substrates. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial in revealing self-organized periodic interstitials near the interface, which arise from this higher-order lattice matching. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction showed that this growth method strongly suppresses the tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural transition typically observed in bulk FeTe. Remarkably, these films exhibited substrate-selective two-dimensional superconductivity, likely due to the suppressed monoclinic distortion, highlighting higher-order epitaxy as a powerful tool to control materials and induce emergent phenomena.

- **Authors**: Hanchen Wang, William Legrand, Davit Petrosyan, Min-Gu Kang, Emir Karadža, Hiroki Matsumoto, Richard Schlitz, Michaela Lammel, Myriam H. Aguirre, Pietro Gambardella
- **Date**: 2025-10-08
- **Objective**: To epitaxially grow nm-thick bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) films with tunable and compensated magnetic anisotropy for spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices.
- **Finding**: The study successfully achieved epitaxial growth of nm-thick bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) films by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering, demonstrating precise control over magnetic properties through sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain. Films remained fully strained up to 60 nm thickness, maintaining high crystalline quality even with significant lattice mismatch. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed coherent epitaxial growth, absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Tuning tensile or compressive strain allowed accurate compensation of total magnetic anisotropy via magneto-elastic coupling. Optimized growth conditions yielded a low ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1 mT at 10 GHz for 10 nm films, highlighting the potential of these strain-engineered BiYIG films for advanced spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices.

- **Authors**: F. Liu, Z. Yang, Y. Luo, S. Guo, C. Zhang, S. Choo, X. Xu, X. Wang, K. A. Mkhoyan, M. Bernardi, B. Jalan
- **Date**: 2025-10-08
- **Objective**: To achieve a microscopic understanding of large-polaron transport in anatase TiO$_2$ films by combining high-quality synthesis with first-principles many-body theory.
- **Finding**: The researchers combined hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for growing high-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase TiO$_2$ films with a first-principles electron-phonon diagrammatic Monte Carlo (FEP-DMC) framework. Their films exhibited record-high electron mobility for anatase TiO$_2$, in excellent agreement with FEP-DMC predictions of 45 $\pm$ 15 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at room temperature and a mobility-temperature scaling of mobility proportional to T$^{\text{-1.9} \pm \text{0.077}}$. Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the critical role of oxygen vacancies in modulating transport at lower temperatures. FEP-DMC further provided quantitative insights into polaron formation energy, phonon cloud distribution, lattice distortion, and polaronic contribution to mobility, establishing a predictive theory-experiment workflow for characterizing polarons in complex oxides.

- **Authors**: Luke Besley, P. S. Jørgensen, A. Diaz, C. Detlefs, S. De Angelis, M. Carlsen, B. Chang, C. Silvestre, J. W. Andreasen
- **Date**: 2025-10-08
- **Objective**: To develop a versatile 3D reconstruction framework for hard X-ray grazing incidence imaging, overcoming limitations of conventional ptychography algorithms for nanoscale structures.
- **Finding**: The study presents a ptychographic reconstruction framework designed for hard X-ray grazing incidence imaging, which replaces the conventional single-scattering model with a multislice wave-propagation formalism tailored to grazing incidence. This framework is crucial for accurately capturing significant multiple scattering that occurs in grazing incidence. It supports simultaneous phase retrieval and reconstruction, and can integrate multiple incidence and rotation angles, as well as flexible experimental geometries, into a single inversion. The framework enables the recovery of complex surface and near-surface nanostructures from a random guess without strong structural priors, demonstrating its versatility on both experimental and simulated datasets.

- **Date**: 2025-10-07
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the formation of Neel-type skyrmions at high temperatures in simple ferromagnetic alloys by imposing a vertical strain gradient via epitaxy.
- **Finding**: The researchers demonstrated the formation of Neel-type skyrmions in thin layers of simple ferromagnetic alloys, namely Co-Al and Co-Ni-Al, over a wide temperature range up to 770 K. This was achieved by imposing a vertical strain gradient through epitaxy with an Ir-Al underlayer. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) was instrumental for direct observation of these Neel skyrmions in freestanding membranes at high temperatures, while x-ray diffraction anomalous peak profiles directly measured the strain gradient. This concept allows simple centrosymmetric ferromagnets with high magnetic ordering temperatures to exhibit hot skyrmions, thereby bringing closer skyrmionic electronics.

- **Date**: 2025-10-06
- **Objective**: To provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in theory and instrumentation of time-resolved and ultrafast electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) for imaging nanoscale carrier, thermal, and structural dynamics.
- **Finding**: This review article provides a comprehensive overview of time-resolved and ultrafast electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), an emerging technique that uses specialized scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) or ultrafast electron microscopes (UEM) to measure photoexcited carriers, lattice dynamics, and near-fields from femtosecond to microsecond timescales. It details theoretical approaches for calculating and interpreting ground-state and transient EEL spectra, covering low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations. The review highlights the technique's ability to directly image carrier and thermal dynamics and discusses future directions enabled by advancements like electron beam monochromation, in situ and operando cells, laser-free UEM, and high-speed direct electron detectors, positioning time-resolved and ultrafast EELS as a critical tool for uncovering nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum materials and solar energy conversion devices.

**21. [Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy of quantum wire-like dislocation states in ZnS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05357v1)**
- **Authors**: Alexander Blackston, Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Sevim Polat Genlik, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Roberto C. Myers
- **Date**: 2025-10-06
- **Objective**: To experimentally test predictions of 1D dispersive electronic bands confined to dislocation cores in ZnS by correlating sub-bandgap optical transitions with dislocation density.
- **Finding**: The study experimentally supports the existence of 1D dispersive electronic bands confined to dislocation cores in the wide bandgap semiconductor ZnS. Scanning electron microscopy-based electron channeling contrast imaging (SEM-ECCI) was used to quantify the densities of four predicted partial dislocations formed during strain relaxation in epitaxial ZnS. Room-temperature ellipsometry revealed absorption peaks that scaled with dislocation density and aligned with theoretical predictions. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra showed deep emission peaks matching dislocation 1D band-to-band transitions. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy further revealed six distinct emission lines, with four peaks (2.78, 2.41, 2.20, 1.88 eV) assigned to dislocations exhibiting only modest suppression ($\leq$5$\times$) when excited below the ZnS bandgap, confirming efficient, 1D band-to-band radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core states.

- **Authors**: Fabia F. Athena, Cooper A. Voigt, Mengkun Tian, Anjan Goswami, Emily Toph, Moses Nnaji, Fanuel Mammo, Brent K. Wagner, Sungho Jeon, Wenshan Cai, Eric M. Vogel
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To report a novel phase of indium selenide exhibiting room-temperature ferroelectricity due to broken inversion symmetry in a van der Waals material.
- **Finding**: The researchers identified a unique $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide in synthesized large-area films, distinct from previously reported polymorphs. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis was crucial in characterizing the quintuple layers of this new phase, revealing a unique zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths from the middle selenium atom, and intralayer shifting in cross-sectional views. The $\beta^\text{p}$ layers exhibited electric-field-induced switchable polarization, characteristic of ferroelectric materials, and nonlinear optical phenomena (Second Harmonic Generation, SHG) responses, both supporting the conclusion of broken inversion symmetry and room-temperature ferroelectricity in this low-dimensional van der Waals material.

- **Authors**: Miloš Baljozović, Shiladitya Karmakar, André L. Fernandes Cauduro, Mothuku Shyam Sundar, Marco Lozano, Manish Kumar, Diego Soler Polo, Andreas K. Schmid, Ashutosh V. Bedekar, Pavel Jelinek, Karl-Heinz Ernst
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface.
- **Finding**: The study reports the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements were instrumental in revealing spin-dependent electron reflectivity, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments ruled out artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations and an extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model attributed this magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. This finding reveals a novel mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components.

**24. [Observation of a Novel CDW Superstructure in Monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at Room Temperature and its Evolution in Multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03800v1)**
- **Authors**: Samanta Pal, Kaustuv Chatterjee, A. K. Raychaudhuri, Prabir Pal
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To investigate the charge density wave (CDW) superstructure in monolayer 1T-VS$_2$ at room temperature and its evolution in multilayer systems.
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully prepared monolayer (ML) 1T-VS$_2$ via liquid phase exfoliation and stamp transfer, observing a room-temperature charge density wave (CDW) transition. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) were crucial for revealing the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases, with only the 1T phase undergoing the CDW transition. They discovered a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1$^\circ$ in ML 1T-VS$_2$. With increasing layers, the CDW order evolved into a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure. Angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy showed that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as V$^{3+}$ ions in multilayer VS$_2$, explaining the CDW evolution.

**25. [In-situ characterisation and data-driven crystal plasticity analysis of short-to-long crack transition in a ductile aluminium alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03713v1)**
- **Authors**: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To conduct an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation and the short-to-long crack transition in a ductile aluminum alloy, combined with data-driven crystal plasticity analysis.
- **Finding**: The study conducted an in-situ, high-resolution experimental investigation of crack propagation in cold-worked 5052 aluminum alloy. Scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were used to characterize crack interaction with microstructural features. These EM-related techniques, combined with novel data-driven crystal plasticity modeling, allowed for direct calculation of stress and extraction of local (elastic) mode I and II stress intensity factors (SIFs) and energy release rates. The findings revealed that microstructure-sensitive short cracks grow in a quasi-brittle manner at low energy release rates. A critical energy release rate marks the transition to plasticity-dominated crack arrest, where the crack's process zone becomes large enough to induce plastic deformation and blunt the crack, establishing that this transition is governed by the process zone rather than length scale.
