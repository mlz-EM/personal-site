**1. [Field-induced reversible phase transition and negative differential resistance in In2Se3 ferroelectric semiconducting FETs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09233v1)**
- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and elucidate its underlying field-induced phase transition mechanism.
- **Finding**: The study observed gate-tunable NDR with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ FeS-FETs. Combining **high-resolution electron microscopy** with electrical transport measurements, the NDR was attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. **Atomic scale ex-situ imaging** further revealed that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments generating Moiré patterns, and intralayer shear, all contributing to stress-induced phase transitions. This highlights the promise of 2D ferroelectric devices for multifunctional nanoelectronics.

**2. [Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497v1)**
- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: To study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS$_2$) nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and explain experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations.
- **Finding**: Molecular Dynamics simulations revealed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes as the nanoparticle edges are approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental **High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM)** observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained these experimental observations by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need for full MD modeling for accurate **HR-TEM** image interpretation. The study also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials to accurately extrapolate Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to larger systems.

- **Finding**: A dual-branch multimodal VAE, trained on paired polarized dark-field scattering spectra and **electron microscopy images**, successfully predicted the in-plane orientation and aspect ratio of gold NRs using only spectral input. The VAE achieved comparable performance to physics-based $\cos(2\theta)$ fitting for orientational angle (MAE 14.4 vs 8.78, CCC 0.95 vs 0.99) and aspect ratio (MAE 0.21 vs 0.23, CCC 0.53 vs 0.68) with a small training set of 300 particles. **Electron microscopy images** were crucial for providing the ground truth for training the VAE, enabling the model to learn a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, thus offering a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems.

- **Finding**: The study successfully synthesized the previously unreported 1T$'$ crystal phase of CrS$_2$ and tuneably grew either 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ or 1T CrS$_2$ using MOCVD. The phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and **4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction**. **4DSTEM characterization** revealed that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation process from 1T to 1T$'$, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals. Magneto-optic Kerr imaging showed soft ferromagnetic nature in 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ at low temperatures, shedding light on the magnetic properties of this just predicted material.

- **Finding**: **Operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with electric field biasing** directly resolved a multi-step antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in PbZrO$_3$ thin films under device-relevant conditions, including several metastable phases. **Atomic-resolution imaging** and **nano-beam electron diffraction** further showed that this pathway and its end states can be modulated, leading to the formation of a "dead layer" near the substrate with suppressed switching behavior. Dynamic phase transformations were observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases at a transition front, driven by competing internal and external fields, providing key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions.

- **Authors**: Jeffrey Huang, Yichao Zhang, Sang hyun Bae, Ballal Ahammed, Elif Ertekin, Pinshane Y. Huang
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To solve the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy to map defects and Moiré corrugations, which strongly modify electronic properties.
- **Finding**: The study successfully solved the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy using **multislice electron ptychography (MEP)** acquired from a single orientation. The resulting atomic models individually visualized each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in the interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies, which were found exclusively in the outer Se planes. A new, unexpected type of structural disorder consisting of mixed bending- and breathing-type Moiré-induced corrugations was also observed, which should strongly impact the emergent electronic properties. This method generates 3D atom-by-atom models from data acquired in about 30 seconds, unlocking routine access to 3D atomic information in 2D systems.

**7. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v2)**
- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and underlying fracture mechanisms in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging followed by slow strain tensile testing resulted in brittle fracture within the elastic regime of the DP steel. **Fractographic studies** indicated intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology at surface crack initiation, while **site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations** revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture, with **site-specific TEM** and **transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies** revealing {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. **Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies** on cross-sectional cracks supported the explanation of HE via a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen diffusion promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity.

**8. [Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166v1)**
- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: To investigate how dopants self-organize and alter local structure within amorphous interfacial complexions in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys.
- **Finding**: **High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** and **elemental analysis** were used to study grain and interphase boundaries, revealing chemical partitioning. The amorphous-crystalline transition region was observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others, a chemical patterning explained by elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. While **nanobeam electron diffraction** provided qualitative measures of structural short-range order, atomistic simulations confirmed that increased grain boundary chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure sensitive to dopant ratios.

**9. [Deep Learning-Assisted Weak Beam Identification in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05017v1)**
- **Authors**: A. Benhadjira, C. Detlefs, S. Borgi, V. Favre-Nicolin, C. Yildirim
- **Date**: 2025-09-05
- **Objective**: To develop a deep learning framework for automating the reliable identification of weak- versus strong-beam conditions in Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) for quantitative dislocation characterization.
- **Finding**: The study introduced a deep learning framework that automates the critical task of identifying weak- versus strong-beam conditions in DFXM using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). This is crucial because weak-beam imaging enhances dislocation contrast, while strong-beam conditions obscure interpretation, a challenge analogous to electron microscopy. The CNN, trained on small, hand-labeled datasets, enabled robust, rapid, and scalable identification of imaging conditions, transforming DFXM into a high-throughput tool for statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials.

- **Finding**: The researchers developed a simplified fabrication method for all-polymer metasurfaces using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the resonator material, eliminating complex multi-step procedures. A bilayer recipe enabled the convenient fabrication of a freestanding membrane, maximizing index contrast and featuring high-quality nanopatterns due to the circumvention of etching-induced defects. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** was used to examine the suspended membrane, and nanoindentation experiments with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip extracted its position-dependent spring constant and pretension. The all-polymer metasurface experimentally delivered high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, demonstrating straightforward geometry-based tuning of linewidth and resonance position.

- **Authors**: Kuan Ding, Atsutomo Nakamura, Patrick Cordier, Xufei Fang
- **Date**: 2025-09-05
- **Objective**: To understand the fundamental processes of dislocation-grain boundary (GB) interaction at room temperature in polycrystalline ceramics using a model bi-crystal SrTiO$_3$ system.
- **Finding**: Using room-temperature Brinell indentation to generate a plastic zone in bi-crystal SrTiO$_3$ with a 4$^\circ$ tilt GB (an array of edge dislocations), the study directly assessed GB-dislocation interaction without crack formation. Combined with dislocation etch pits imaging and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis**, the researchers observed dislocation pileup, storage, and transmission across the low-angle tilt GB. These experimental observations provide new insights into mesoscale dislocation-GB interaction at room temperature, which is crucial for developing strategies for crack suppression and dislocation engineering in ceramics.

- **Date**: 2025-09-04
- **Objective**: To investigate thickness-induced topological phase transitions in $\alpha$-Sn films grown on CdTe(110) using helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC) and structural characterization.
- **Finding**: The study observed distinct helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC) behavior in $\alpha$-Sn films of varying thicknesses, indicating a thickness-driven topological phase transition. Combined with **high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM)**, point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, it was revealed that a topological phase transition from a 2D to a 3D topological insulator occurs between 5 and 10 nm film thickness. **HR-TEM** provided crucial structural information supporting the identification of these different topological phases, demonstrating HDPC as a sensitive diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions and establishing $\alpha$-Sn(110) as a versatile platform for exploring emerging topological phenomena.

It highlights the capability of these approaches to analyze processes on microscopic to macroscopic scales. While primarily focusing on optical methods, the review discusses various ultrafast optical imaging schemes, including microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging, which can be analogous to electron microscopy principles in their ability to visualize transient phenomena and material restructuring.

- **Finding**: The study proposed a plug-and-play framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided image editing using foundational diffusion models to enhance **ptychographic** image quality. By employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the approach ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal, addressing issues like grid pathology and multislice crosstalk common in **electron ptychography**, is achieved using a text-guided diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational diffusion model. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets showed significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, making it a transferable and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging.

**15. [Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00943v1)**
- **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
- **Date**: 2025-08-31
- **Objective**: To apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te phase-change materials.
- **Finding**: The study developed a protocol for clustering **4D-STEM** data to differentiate phases in Ge-Sb-Te glasses. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), k-means clustering identified four distinct clusters, which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures (e.g., oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium in Cluster 4) changing across clusters. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. This demonstrates that **4D-STEM** combined with clustering analysis provides a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features, offering deeper insights into the intrinsic heterogeneity of phase-change materials.

- **Authors**: Tomoya Nakatani, Nattamon Suwannaharn, Taisuke Sasaki
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the structure and anisotropic electrical resistivity of single-crystalline CoSn kagome metal thin films for potential interconnect applications.
- **Finding**: The study achieved epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer, exhibiting low resistivity along the [0001] direction and approximately tenfold anisotropy in resistivity between [0001] and [2-1-10] (a-axis), consistent with bulk CoSn. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films. This **STEM** characterization was crucial for understanding the film's microstructure, which contributed to the observed surface roughness and highlighted challenges in accurately evaluating thickness-dependent resistivity.

**17. [Molecular Beam Epitaxy of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21537v1)**
- **Authors**: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To grow epitaxial 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001) using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and characterize their structural and electronic properties.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers were successfully grown on GaN(0001), with high substrate growth temperatures (825$^\circ$C) yielding optimal structural properties, as revealed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED). The 2D overlayer grew unstrained after monolayer deposition. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** provided evidence of pits at the interface, likely due to GaN thermal decomposition at high growth temperatures. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) showed core level shifts consistent with electron transfer from n-GaN(0001) to 2H-TaS$_2$ and nitrogen vacancy formation, but no chemical reaction at the interface, corroborating the possibility of integrating 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with 3D semiconducting GaN.

- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To develop and demonstrate a hydrofluoric acid-free chemical etching method for titanium, a material used in rare-event search experiments, to remove surface deposits and improve radiopurity.
- **Finding**: The study presented an alternative chemical etching method for titanium using sulphuric acid, successfully removing 3.7 $\mu$m of material from the surface over 20 hours. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with back-scattered electron spectroscopy** was used to study the titanium surface and contamination, clearly demonstrating the removal of surface contaminants after etching. This proposed method offers a safer alternative to conventional hydrofluoric acid etching, which poses serious health risks, particularly for construction in deep underground laboratories requiring high radiopurity materials.

- **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To investigate how epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry control polarization and stabilize polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry can control polarization and stabilize polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films. Despite the stabilizing effect of the metallic buffer, large anisotropic compressive strain promoted ferroelectric domain formation. **Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM)** and **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** revealed that the nanoscale domain architecture was stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the buffer-imposed polarization. By inserting a Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer layer, a uniform out-of-plane polarization was stabilized in highly strained BFO films. **STEM** was essential for visualizing the domain structure and identifying the interfacial Bi$_2$O$_2$ layer, providing key insights into the polarization compensation mechanism and control of chiral textures.

- **Finding**: The study successfully developed a machine learning framework where a convolutional neural network (CNN) accurately infers elemental compositions and predicts **EDS maps** directly from **4D-STEM diffraction patterns**. This approach significantly reduces beam exposure and acquisition time, which is critical for sensitive samples. The CNN demonstrated consistent performance for both extrapolation and interpolation strategies, with improved predictions when additional structural context was available, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations like Oxygen and Tellurium. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirmed the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends, establishing a data-driven pathway to non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization by leveraging the rich structural information from **4D-STEM** to infer chemical information.

- **Authors**: Zanlin Cheng, Jiawen Zhang, Peng Gao, Guosong Zeng, Xufei Fang, Wenjun Lu
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To explore a new approach for improving the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching significantly mitigates the formation of cleavage cracks in (001)-oriented $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, enhancing its damage tolerance. By applying a Brinell indenter to scratch the surface, edge-type dislocations belonging to specific slip systems were effectively generated within a mesoscale wear track. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** were crucial for microstructural characterization, revealing that these mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers facilitate stable plastic deformation and prevent brittle fracture during indentation, in contrast to the as-received material.

- **Finding**: The study introduced a novel method for 3D strain field determination using **4D-STEM**, addressing the challenge of measuring strain variations along the electron beam direction. This method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which are sensitive to strain field variations. The researchers tested the method against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrated its application to an experimental **4D-STEM** dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer. This advancement in **(scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM)** provides crucial capabilities for understanding and engineering material properties through 3D strain analysis.

**24. [Atomistic Structure of Transient Switching States in Ferroelectric AlScN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18241v1)**
- **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching and the atomistic structure of transient switching states in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN.
- **Finding**: The study resolved the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced thin-film fabrication, ferroelectric switching dynamics, **high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**, and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. It demonstrated that previously observed broad transitional regions in **STEM images** are projection artifacts from the intrinsic 3D zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. This was further confirmed by **STEM imaging** of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Simulations revealed switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, explaining the zigzag domain walls and observed nucleation-limited switching behavior, with increasing Sc content lowering domain wall energy and switching field.

**25. [Crystalline-to-Crystalline Phase Transition between Germanium Selenide Polymorphs with High Resistance Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17997v1)**
- **Authors**: Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the crystalline-to-crystalline phase transition between GeSe polymorphs induced by thermal annealing or laser heating, and to understand the underlying mechanisms and electrical properties.
- **Finding**: The study investigated the phase transition where highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe, preserving crystal orientation, induced by global annealing or localized laser heating. **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis** was crucial for investigating the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface. The researchers proposed that clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures drives the transition, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through minor GeSe$_2$ phase segregation. A high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$ between the two polymorphs was observed, highlighting GeSe's potential as a model polymorphic system for electronic applications like phase-change memory.

**26. [Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17085v1)**
-   **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
-   **Date**: 2025-08-23
-   **Objective**: Investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations in the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand its underlying mechanisms.
-   **Finding**: The study observed Shockley partial dislocations ($a/6<112>$) cross-slipping from one $\{111\}$ plane to another $\{111\}$ conjugate plane, facilitated by stair-rod dislocation formation. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were crucial in characterizing stacking faults, dislocations, and associated chemical fluctuations. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing the energies of stacking faults and dislocations, while local stress concentrations also played a critical role. This mechanism, leading to sessile stair-rod dislocations, enhances the high-temperature deformation resistance of the alloy.
