**1. [Energy-Resolved Real-Space Imaging of Orbital Nematicity in an Fe-Based Superconductor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02707v1)**
- **Authors**: Asato Onishi, Zifan Xu, Cédric Bareille, Yoichi Kageyama, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Taniuchi, Takasada Shibauchi
- **Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Objective**: To visualize the energy dependence of orbital nematicity (linear dichroic contrast) in real space within individual nematic domains of $\mathrm{Ba}_{1-x}\mathrm{Na}_x\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{As}_2$.
- **Finding**: Using $5.82\ \mathrm{eV}$ laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM), researchers observed a sign reversal of the linear dichroic (LD) contrast at an energy $\sim 0.4\ \mathrm{eV}$ below the Fermi level. This directly revealed an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain, reflecting a different energy-dependent redistribution of spectral weight between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ states. Laser-PEEM provided the crucial energy-resolved real-space imaging necessary to map the nematic domains and their energy evolution.

**2. [Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01846v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop a full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process and to clarify the relationship between the Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect, Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect, and nonlinear Compton scattering.
- **Finding**: The full quantum theory revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by free electrons can be significantly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of the optical near field, leading to quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes. Furthermore, the KD effect (elastic scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic scattering) were identified as specific types of two-photon processes, providing a unified theoretical framework for these phenomena observed in electron microscopy experiments.

- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To report the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite ($\mathrm{MgSiO}_3$) nanoparticles using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry.
- **Finding**: The surface enthalpy of enstatite was determined to be $4.79 \pm 0.45\ \mathrm{J}\ \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, a large value suggesting a barrier to nucleation in planetary environments.

- **Date**: 2025-12-31
- **Objective**: To determine how the confined geometry of palladium ($\mathrm{Pd}$) nanocrystals influences the structural dynamics and pathways of the $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ phase transformation during hydrogenation.
- **Finding**: In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) allowed direct visualization of hydrogenation in Pd nanocubes and hexagonal nanoplates. While both followed similar nucleation sequences, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces displayed geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments ($\{100\}$ in cubes vs. $\{110\}$ and $\{211\}$ in nanoplates). LP-TEM provided real-time, nanoscale observation, demonstrating that geometry is a fundamental parameter directing phase transformation pathways far from equilibrium.

- **Date**: 2025-12-30
- **Objective**: To use non-Euclidean interfaces (curved graphene-copper surfaces) to decode the continuous crystallographic landscape governing interfacial reconstruction between 2D materials and metal substrates.
- **Finding**: By integrating multimodal microscopy with a deep-learning-enhanced dimensional upscaling framework, 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) contrast was translated into quantitative 3D morphologies, allowing accurate facet identification. This analysis, coupled with DFT, demonstrated that reconstruction is governed by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local energy minima, resolving the complexity of graphene-copper faceting.

**10. [Exploring phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals using liquid-phase TEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23588v1)**
- **Authors**: Olga Kaczmarczyk, Konrad Cyprych, Dominika Benkowska-Biernacka, Rafał Kowalczyk, Katarzyna Matczyszyn, Hanglong Wu, Frances M. Ross, Andrzej Miniewicz, Andrzej Żak
- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **Objective**: To perform in situ observations of mesophase stability, defect topology, and dynamic response of nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM).
- **Finding**: LP-STEM revealed that the electron beam induced consecutive thermal phase transitions from smectic A to nematic ($\mathrm{SmA}-\mathrm{N}$) and nematic to isotropic ($\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{I}$). The kinetic dependence on dose rate suggested that localized heat generation drives the transitions, implying nanoconfined 8CB has significantly different thermal properties than its bulk form. This study represents the first detailed analysis of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, including the observation of spontaneous disclination formation.

**11. [Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $\mathrm{SrVO}_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843v1)**
- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a direct and controllable approach for recovering the intrinsic metallic surface of $\mathrm{SrVO}_3$ (SVO) by thermally reducing the oxidized near-surface region (NSR) under ultra-high vacuum.
- **Finding**: Real-time in-situ XPS showed a sharp transformation from a $\mathrm{V}^{5+}$-dominated surface to a $\mathrm{V}^{4+}$-dominated metallic state. Ex-situ high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and AFM indicated that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and nanoscale surface reorganization, suggesting a structural recovery mechanism rather than simple volatilization of $\mathrm{V}_2\mathrm{O}_5$.

- **Authors**: Shaozun Liu, Zehao Li, Hantong Chen, Xingyuan San, Bi-Cheng Zhou, Dieter Isheim, Tiejun Wang, Hong Gao, Nie Zhao, Yu Liu, Yong Gan, Xiaobing Hu
- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the effects of W concentration on short-range order (SRO), grain boundary chemistry, and subsequent deformation behavior in $\mathrm{Ni}-\mathrm{xW}$ alloys.
- **Finding**: Strong SRO emerges above $30\ \mathrm{wt}\% \ \mathrm{W}$, significantly enhancing strain-hardening capacity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that SRO promotes planar slip and twin formation during deformation. Atom probe tomography (APT) provided atomic-scale chemical insight, confirming that increasing W content stabilizes $\mathrm{Ni}_4\mathrm{W}$-type local configurations, which drives the SRO tendency and intrinsic strengthening effect.

- **Finding**: FF-STEM combines high-resolution ptychographic phase reconstruction (from bright-field data) with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging (providing low-frequency contrast) within a single acquisition. The optimal fusion of these channels in Fourier space yields transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity, significantly improving the routine use and dose efficiency of linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

**28. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of varying $\text{Pt}/\text{Ru}$ ratios in electrodeposited overlays on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of $\text{NiCoCrAlYTa}$ coatings.
- **Finding**: Higher Pt content resulted in superior oxidation resistance due to the formation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous $\alpha-\text{Al}_{2}\text{O}_{3}$ layer in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO). Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDS) confirmed the microstructural differences in the TGO layer, showing that increased Ru content led to the development of microcracks and other detrimental oxides.

- **Objective**: To describe and demonstrate a newly developed monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) detector designed to improve the performance of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) in low-energy scanning electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The high sensitivity of the MAPS detector enables EBSD at significantly lower electron energies and doses compared to existing scintillator-coupled detectors, thus expanding grain orientation mapping capabilities to challenging materials like ceramics. The detector also allows for the measurement and energy filtering of single electron interaction events, revealing detailed diffraction pattern information and providing dislocation defect contrast otherwise inaccessible via EBSD.

**32. [Observation of REBCO delamination in the resistive insulation nested coils](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16647v1)**
- **Authors**: Jun Lu, Iain Dixon, Kwangmin Kim, Yan Xin, Hongyu Bai
- **Date**: 2025-12-18
- **Objective**: To investigate the failure mechanism of $\text{REBCO}$ coated conductor coils that exhibited premature resistive transitions during high-field magnet testing.
- **Finding**: Postmortem inspection of the failed double pancake modules revealed sections with very low critical current, which further investigation confirmed was due to conductor delamination—a mechanical failure mode resulting from the intrinsic layered structure of the $\text{REBCO}$ tape. Electron microscopy was used in the detailed postmortem characterization to visually confirm the physical delamination of the $\text{REBCO}$ conductor section.

**33. [Probing formation and epitaxy of ultrathin Titanium Silicide using low and medium energy ion scattering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16479v1)**
- **Authors**: Philipp M. Wolf, Eduardo Pitthan, Zhen Zhang, Tuan T. Tran, Radek Holeňák, Daniel Primetzhofer
- **Date**: 2025-12-18
- **Objective**: To examine the formation and epitaxial structure of ultrathin titanium silicide ($\text{Ti}$-silicide) on $\text{Si}(100)$ using ion scattering techniques.
- **Finding**: Annealing at $500^\circ\text{C}$ resulted in a $\text{Ti}$-rich polycrystalline surface layer and a $\text{Si}$-rich interface layer exhibiting strong ordering along the $\text{Si}$ [100] axis. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) images confirmed these findings, revealing an epitaxial silicide layer approximately $1.5$ nm thick at the interface, which is critical for minimizing contact resistivity in advanced semiconductor devices.

**35. [Visualizing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of GaN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15989v1)**
- **Authors**: Abby Liu, Zhucong Xi, Xiaobo Chen, Catherine Huang, Meng Li, Judith C. Yang, Liang Qi, Dmitri N. Zakharov, Rachel S. Goldman
- **Date**: 2025-12-17
- **Objective**: To elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the metal-mediated nucleation and growth of Gallium Nitride ($\text{GaN}$) from $\text{Ga}$ droplet arrays using real-time observation.
- **Finding**: Real-time Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (E-TEM) revealed that $\text{GaN}$ growth preferentially occurs at pre-existing $\text{GaN}$ nuclei at low temperatures, while intermediate to high temperatures facilitate nucleation and growth both with and without nuclei, leading to enhanced crystallinity via epitaxial templating. E-TEM visualization highlighted the critical role of the $\text{Ga}/\text{GaN}$ interface in facilitating $\text{NH}_3$ decomposition and subsequent $\text{GaN}$ growth.

- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate how a Scandium Nitride ($\text{ScN}$) buffer layer affects the superconducting properties of thin Niobium Nitride ($\text{NbN}$) films.
- **Finding**: The $\text{ScN}$ buffer layer significantly improved the characteristics of $29$ nm thick $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing the critical temperature $T_c$ from $9$ K to $12.5$ K and reducing resistivity. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction data confirmed that this enhancement is due to better lattice matching between $\text{NbN}$ and $\text{ScN}$, resulting in a higher quality crystal lattice in the $\text{NbN}$ film.

- **Authors**: Komal Singh, Jyoti Sindkar, Mrunal Ramdasi, Vrishali Jadhav, Rohidas B. Kale
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To synthesize tin dioxide ($\text{SnO}_2$) nanoparticles using the hydrothermal method and study the influence of surfactants on their characteristics and photocatalytic performance.
- **Finding**: Surfactant variation significantly impacted the crystallinity, size, and shape of the $\text{SnO}_2$ nanoparticles, which formed a tetragonal rutile phase. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology, revealing particle aggregation in samples with higher precursor concentration, and the sample containing PEG as a surfactant demonstrated the best photocatalytic activity for Methylene Blue degradation.

**38. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: To report and investigate a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ at room temperature.
- **Finding**: The EO effect originates from defect-bound unpaired electrons whose slow polarization relaxation (DC drift) is quenched upon the magnetic-field-induced formation of room-temperature skyrmion states. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) directly visualized this collective spin ordering, confirming that it transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, achieving an EO coefficient enhancement up to $34$ pm/V in $\text{LiNbO}_3$.

- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and spectroscopic properties of a natural diamond containing Y-defects.
- **Finding**: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects, including extended defects identified as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) with dimensions up to $20$ nm. It is suggested that the observed unusual, blinking photoluminescence lines (800-900 nm) are caused by recombination processes occurring at the internal walls of these nanovoids discovered by TEM.

- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between temperature and thickness on the morphology and dynamics of ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: In situ heating experiments revealed that DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) are mobile near the critical temperature ($T_C$) but freeze upon cooling, whereas DWs in the crossover regime ($200-300$ nm) remain nearly static. In situ heating Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), combined with machine-learning-driven image analysis, was used to quantitatively track DW curvature and density across the thermal cycle, mapping the evolution of DWs from super-elastic to freezing regimes.

**43. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) imaging of nanometric skyrmion lattices and assess the quantitative limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall magnetic textures.
- **Finding**: Conventional analysis of Fresnel LTEM images, particularly using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), resulted in an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon for ultrasmall skyrmions. Systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations confirmed that these chiral misinterpretations arise from the sinusoidal modulation of the contrast transfer function, which is strongly dependent on the defocus value and the ultrasmall skyrmion dimensions.

**44. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies in a $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet, which mimic the topological Hall effect (THE).
- **Finding**: Although Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, they did not correlate with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, distinguishing them from true THE signals associated with chiral spin textures. Crucially, Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) measurements ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures, leading the authors to attribute the anomalies instead to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels caused by sample inhomogeneity.

- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) that eliminates the need for handcrafted, object-specific constraints using physics-guided neural fields.
- **Finding**: CDIP, which combines untrained coordinate-based neural fields with a physics-consistent forward model, substantially outperformed classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in fidelity and stability across static and dynamic datasets. This framework offers a paradigm shift for coherent imaging modalities, including electron ptychography and holography, by improving reconstruction robustness across various probes.

**46. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework detailing the three-dimensional strain control mechanisms (elongation, tilting, and collapse) of magnetic skyrmion strings.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and simulations predicted strain-induced elongation and tilting, and subsequent rupture of skyrmion strings via bobber formation at critical strain levels. In situ Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) experiments on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed the strain-induced elongation and collapse into a conical phase, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary control mechanism.

**47. [Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09067v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models used for High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) imaging with respect to varying imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: Neural network segmentation models trained on synthetic data show significant performance stability but predictably and smoothly worsen as imaging conditions shift away from the training distribution. The study developed a framework utilizing the HRTEM contrast transfer function to quantify this OOD domain shift, providing essential insight into the reliability of deep learning models in experimental HRTEM workflows.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnet alloys.
- **Finding**: Calculations revealed that while $K_{\rm u}$ is positive under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with $25\%$ compressive strain, highlighting the critical role of lattice distortions near grain boundaries. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) measurements provided the essential experimental input by revealing compressive strain of up to $25\%$ near grain boundaries in the fabricated $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys.

- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) hosts photoluminescent color centers, potentially identifying a new platform for solid-state quantum emitters.
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in meteoritic lonsdaleite, exhibiting bright and stable emission (peak $\approx 700$ nm) with a $14$ ns excited-state lifetime. Correlative electron microscopy was essential to confirm the lonsdaleite host lattice structure, verifying that the observed fluorescent color center resides within the hexagonal diamond phase.

**50. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To observe and understand the spatial evolution of strain-induced spin rearrangement, specifically the reorientation of the helical domain propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$), under quantitatively applied uniaxial stress.
- **Finding**: In situ Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) revealed that the reorientation of the helical phase is mediated by magnetic topological defects through processes analogous to plastic deformation ("break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation"). LTEM allowed for the direct visualization and manipulation of the helical domains, showing that the critical stress for $\textbf{Q}$ reorientation depends on its angle with the stress direction.
