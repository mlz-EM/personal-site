**31. [Anisotropy at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ ($R$=rare earth, $T$=transition metal) magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07724v1)**
- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: To determine the intrinsic magnetic properties, specifically anisotropy, at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ permanent magnets using first-principles calculations, informed by experimental high-resolution electron microscopy images.
- **Finding**: First-principles calculations, based on model interface structures derived from recently reported high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images, revealed that interfaces in $RT_{12}$ magnets modify magnetic properties at the sub-nanometer scale. Specifically, in an R-rich region of a "stacking fault" interface, the local easy axis of magnetization rotated by $49^\circ$ from its bulk direction, which could lead to reduced coercivity by facilitating reverse domain nucleation.
