**1. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v1)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of electron ptychography and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) for imaging beam-sensitive materials by applying the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The study applies detective quantum efficiency (DQE) as a fluence and sample-independent measure to evaluate the performance of HRTEM and ptychography. It finds that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography cannot reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but is more robust to partial coherence. This comparison provides a new metric for evaluating and optimizing electron microscopy techniques.

- **Finding**: Approximately 100 nm-wide channels were nanosculpted into FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films using a Si$^{++}$ focused ion beam (FIB), creating controllable weak links by progressively suppressing critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$) with increasing ion dose. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) corroborated the structural and electronic modifications in the irradiated regions. The study revealed that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion and dissipation, and that FIB patterning offers a simple scalable pathway for fabricating robust Josephson junctions.

- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To investigate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: Gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance was demonstrated in In$_2$Se$_3$ FeS-FETs. High-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) combined with electrical transport measurements attributed the NDR to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging revealed that in-plane electric fields ($V_d$) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments generating Moiré patterns, and intralayer shear, collectively producing stress-induced phase transitions.

- **Objective**: To compare the performance of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and physics-based analysis in determining the geometries (orientation and aspect ratio) of gold nanorods (NRs) using far-field polarized dark-field scattering spectra.
- **Finding**: A dual-branch multimodal VAE, trained on paired scattering spectra and electron microscopy images, was developed to predict the orientation and aspect ratio of gold nanorods using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra. The VAE achieved comparable performance to physics-based methods for orientational angle prediction (MAE of 14.4 and CCC of 0.95 vs. MAE of 8.78 and CCC of 0.99) and aspect ratio determination (MAE of 0.21 and CCC of 0.53 vs. MAE of 0.23 and CCC of 0.68), even with a small training set. This demonstrates the potential of machine learning to infer complex nanostructure geometries from optical data, potentially reducing the need for extensive electron microscopy.

- **Finding**: The tunable synthesis of 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ and 1T CrS$_2$ phases, along with Cr$_2$S$_3$, was achieved via MOCVD. 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction was crucial for uniquely identifying these phases and revealing that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase involves a complex transformation from 1T, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure. The 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperatures, shedding light on the magnetic properties of this newly predicted material.

- **Finding**: Operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with electric field biasing directly resolved a multi-step antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in PbZrO$_3$ thin films, revealing several metastable phases. Atomic-resolution imaging and complementary nano-beam electron diffraction showed that this pathway and its end states could be modulated, leading to a "dead layer" near the substrate with suppressed switching. Dynamic phase transformations between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases were observed at transition fronts, driven by competing internal and external fields, providing key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions.

- **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation was used to solve the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy. The resulting atomic models individually visualized each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies exclusively in the outer Se planes. This method also uncovered a new type of structural disorder involving mixed bending- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations, demonstrating routine access to 3D atomic information in 2D systems.

- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and the mechanism of hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture in the elastic regime of a 1.5 GPa DP steel. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and {100} ferrite cleavage cracking during predominant brittle fracture. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies on cross-sectional cracks, combined with TEM observations, supported a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity ($>V_{crit}$), inhibiting crack blunting and leading to sustained brittle crack growth.

- **Finding**: Chemical partitioning and self-organization of dopants were observed in amorphous interfacial complexions of Cu-rich nanocrystalline alloys. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and elemental analysis were used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, revealing that the amorphous-crystalline transition region is enriched in certain dopant species. Atomistic simulations, informed by these observations, showed that increased grain boundary chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure sensitive to dopant ratios.

- **Finding**: Helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC) measurements revealed a thickness-driven topological phase transition in $\alpha$-Sn films, with a 5 nm film exhibiting odd-function dependence on incident angle and 10 nm and 30 nm films showing even-function dependence. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was combined with point-group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations to confirm a transition from a two-dimensional (2D) to a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator between 5 and 10 nm. This demonstrates HDPC as a sensitive diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions and establishes $\alpha$-Sn(110) as a platform for tunable topological states.
