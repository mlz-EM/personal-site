**1. [Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01846v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process and clarify the relationship between PINEM, Kapitza-Dirac (KD), and nonlinear Compton scattering effects.
- **Finding**: The full quantum theory reveals that the emission/absorption of two photons by free electrons can be significantly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of the optical near field. Quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur, affecting the photon number state and electron energy states. Furthermore, the KD effect (elastic scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic scattering) are identified as types of two-photon processes, whose electron distributions can be analytically deduced.

**27. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate the effect of varying $\text{Pt}/\text{Ru}$ ratios on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of $\text{NiCoCrAlYTa}$ coatings modified with $\text{Pt}-\text{Ru}$ overlays.

- **Authors**: Abby Liu, Zhucong Xi, Xiaobo Chen, Catherine Huang, Meng Li, Judith C. Yang, Liang Qi, Dmitri N. Zakharov, Rachel S. Goldman
- **Date**: 2025-12-17
- **Objective**: To elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the metal-mediated nucleation and growth of $\text{GaN}$ from $\text{Ga}$ droplet arrays.
- **Finding**: Real-time **Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (E-TEM)** revealed that at low temperatures, $\text{GaN}$ growth occurs preferentially at pre-existing $\text{GaN}$ nuclei, attributed to reduced Gibbs free energy for $\text{NH}_3$ decomposition at the $\text{Ga}/\text{GaN}$ interface. At intermediate to high temperatures, E-TEM visualized nucleation and growth from $\text{Ga}$ droplets, with epitaxial templating enhancing crystallinity, highlighting the critical role of the interface in facilitating $\text{GaN}$ formation.

- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate how a scandium nitride ($\text{ScN}$) buffer layer affects the superconducting properties of thin niobium nitride ($\text{NbN}$) films.
- **Finding**: The $\text{ScN}$ buffer layer significantly improved the characteristics of $29\text{ nm}$ thick $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing the critical temperature $T_C$ from $9\text{ K}$ to $12.5\text{ K}$ and reducing resistivity. These enhancements are attributed to better lattice matching between $\text{NbN}$ and $\text{ScN}$, resulting in a higher quality crystal lattice of the $\text{NbN}$ film, as confirmed by **transmission electron microscopy** and X-ray diffraction data.

**37. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: To report a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ at room temperature and identify its underlying physical mechanism.
- **Finding**: The EO effect originates from defect-bound unpaired electrons whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched by magnetic-field-induced formation of room-temperature skyrmion states. **Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)** directly visualized this collective spin ordering, demonstrating that magnetic fields can transform these defect states into a responsive platform, resulting in an order-of-magnitude enhancement of the EO coefficient (up to $34\text{ pm}/\text{V}$ in $\text{LiNbO}_3$).

- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural nature of $\text{Y}$-defects in a natural $\text{Ib}-\text{IaA}$ diamond crystal and correlate them with spectroscopic properties.
- **Finding**: **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** revealed that zones abundant with $\text{Y}$-defects contain dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects generated by non-conservative dislocation motion. Extended defects were observed as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) resembling thin rhombic plates ($1\text{-}3\text{ nm}$ thick), which are suggested to be the internal walls where recombination processes occur, explaining the unusual blinking behavior of observed photoluminescence lines.

- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To map the evolution of ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films, investigating the interplay between temperature and thickness across the dipolar and crossover regimes.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* heating **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** combined with a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach, the study found that DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200\text{ nm}$) are mobile near $T_C$ and freeze upon cooling. In contrast, DWs in the crossover regime ($200\text{-}300\text{ nm}$) are nearly static with minimal reconfiguration, revealing how thickness and temperature govern DW morphology and dynamics.

- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform direct real-space imaging of nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ using Fresnel Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) and assess the reliability of chiral discrimination methods for ultrasmall features.
- **Finding**: Fresnel LTEM studies revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon when analyzed conventionally, which systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations attributed to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function. This finding establishes quantitative limitations for conventional Fresnel contrast analysis when imaging ultrasmall skyrmions and provides fundamental insights into defocus-mediated phase-to-intensity conversion processes in nanoscale magnetic imaging.

**43. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet and determine the origin of its topological-Hall-like resistivity anomaly.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they showed poor correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, suggesting a trivial origin distinct from chiral spin textures. Crucially, **Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)** measurements explicitly ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet, leading to the conclusion that the anomaly stems from the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels due to sample inhomogeneity.

- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework detailing the mechanisms by which three-dimensional strain controls the morphology and stability of magnetic skyrmion strings.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and micromagnetic simulations predicted strain-induced elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, leading to rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. **In situ Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)** experiments on $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, demonstrating that strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the primary mechanism for energy-efficient magnetic control.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance of neural networks used for segmentation in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) based on varying imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: By generating synthetic data and training over 12,000 neural networks, the study demonstrated that network performance smoothly and predictably worsens as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. The **HRTEM Contrast Transfer Function (CTF)** was used to develop a framework that quantifies OOD domain shifts and compares information content, providing a necessary tool for understanding and ensuring the reliability of neural networks in experimental HRTEM workflows.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_u$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnets.
- **Finding**: **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** revealed significant compressive strain, up to $25\%$, near grain boundaries in $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys. Calculations showed that while $K_u$ is positive under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with $25\%$ compressive strain, demonstrating that lattice distortions critically degrade the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, especially at interfaces.

**49. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To observe and understand the spatial evolution and mechanism of helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress, mediated by magnetic topological defects.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* **Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)**, the study visualized that helical domain reorientation under stress is mediated by magnetic defects via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes, analogous to plastic deformation in metals. Simulations suggest that strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a key role, advancing the understanding of strain-driven magnetic nanophase control.
