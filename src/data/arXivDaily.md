- **Finding**: STEM image simulations and experiments demonstrated that intensity differences used to distinguish defects (like C substitutions) become indistinguishable in ADF-STEM images when the hBN thickness exceeds 17 atomic layers ($\text{ca.} 6$ nm); furthermore, residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, were shown to significantly distort STEM contrast, leading to potential misidentification of atomic defects.
