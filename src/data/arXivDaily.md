In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high structural and magnetic resolution was essential to directly observe that these vortices are pinned by underlying dislocation networks, which are formed and rearranged upon repeated phase transitions, establishing a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated phase.

- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals using levitated optomechanical experiments with functionalized silica nanoparticles.
