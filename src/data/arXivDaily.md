- **Authors**: Maciej W. Olszewski, Lingda Kong, Simon Reinhardt, Daniel Tong, Xinyi Du, Gabriele Di Gianluca, Haoran Lu, Saswata Roy, Luojia Zhang, Aleksandra B. Biedron, David A. Muller, Valla Fatemi
- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To achieve scalable synthesis of body-centered cubic ($\alpha$-Ta) superconducting thin films at low substrate temperatures ($\leq 400^\circ\text{C}$) compatible with standard semiconductor fabrication, using krypton ($\text{Kr}$) sputtering.
- **Finding**: Changing the sputter gas from argon to krypton promoted BCC Ta synthesis on silicon at temperatures as low as $200^\circ\text{C}$. Films grown at $250^\circ\text{C}$ and $350^\circ\text{C}$ exhibited state-of-the-art microwave performance (median quality factor up to 14 million in transmon qubits). Cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed that higher losses in high-temperature films correlated directly with the increased degree of $\text{Ta}/\text{Si}$ intermixing.

**3. [Lanthanide-Dependent Clustering in Yb$^{3+}$/Ln$^{3+}$ Co-Doped CaF$_2$ Nanocrystals: Correlating Spectroscopic Signatures with DFT Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19566v1)**
- **Authors**: Sangeetha Balabhadra, Haoming Xu, Jiajia Cai, Chang-Kui Duan, Michael F. Reid, Jon-Paul R. Wells
- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To investigate the formation of heterogeneous lanthanide-ion clusters in $\text{CaF}_2$ nanoparticles co-doped with $\text{Yb}^{3+}$ and various $\text{Ln}^{3+}$ ions, correlating experimental spectroscopic signatures with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
- **Finding**: High-resolution Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy showed that the relative concentration of $\text{Yb}^{3+}$ cluster sites varied significantly with the choice of the co-doping $\text{Ln}^{3+}$ ion. DFT calculations confirmed this variation, indicating that the formation energy of neutral $C_{4v}$ aggregations containing $\text{Ln}^{3+}$ tends to decrease across the lanthanide series. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was utilized to characterize the structural and morphological properties of the synthesized nanocrystals.

- **Authors**: Reed Yalisove, Hongrui Zhang, Xiang Chen, Fanhao Meng, Jie Yao, Robert Birgeneau, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To investigate the metastability of topologically protected magnetic textures, specifically skyrmions, in $(\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Co}_{0.5})_5\text{GeTe}_2$ (FCGT) under controlled temperature and magnetic field conditions.
- **Finding**: By field-cooling FCGT to different base temperatures and then removing the field, various meta(stable) zero-field magnetic states were created, allowing the construction of a phase diagram for these metastable spin structures. *In-situ* Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) was the critical technique used to directly visualize and map these magnetic textures (including skyrmions) as a function of thermal and magnetic history.

**5. [Atomic and Electronic Structure of Strongly Charged Domain Walls in van der Waals $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19137v1)**
- **Authors**: Gillian Nolan, Edmund Han, Shahriar Muhammad Nahid, Patrick Carmichael, Arend M. van der Zande, André Schleife, Pinshane Y. Huang
- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To determine the atomic and electronic structure of strongly charged domain walls (DWs) in the van der Waals ferroelectric $\alpha$-$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$.
- **Finding**: Head-to-head (HH) domain walls were found to contain a layer of nonpolar $\beta$-$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$, while tail-to-tail (TT) DWs were atomically abrupt. Atomic resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) confirmed these structural differences. Furthermore, 4D STEM and multislice electron ptychography were used to map complex, curved 3D domain structures. Band structure calculations showed localized conducting states within a $\sim 1 \text{ nm}$ thick layer at both HH and TT domain walls, making them candidates for 2D electron or hole gases.

- **Date**: 2026-01-25
- **Objective**: To develop a self-correcting residual neural fields framework to achieve dose-efficient and stable reconstruction in ptychography across electron, X-ray, and optical modalities.
- **Finding**: The complex-valued architecture, which reformulates reconstruction as residual learning, preserves intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling and allows joint correction of experimental parameters. The framework achieved record-breaking lensless resolution ($244 \text{ nm}$ linewidth) with visible light and, when extended to electron wavelengths, demonstrated superior performance over conventional approaches by revealing synaptic connectivity in brain sections, enabling high-throughput, dose-efficient electron nanoscopy.

- **Date**: 2026-01-24
- **Objective**: To introduce a scalable, unsupervised clustering algorithm for efficient and physically meaningful analysis of high-dimensional 4D-STEM and 5D-STEM datasets by segmenting crystallographically distinct domains.
- **Finding**: The clustering framework identifies spatially coherent regions using local diffraction-pattern similarity, producing cluster-averaged diffraction patterns that significantly improve signal-to-noise ratio and reduce data volume by orders of magnitude. This approach was demonstrated for quantitative structure-strain mapping, including analysis of *in situ* liquid-cell 4D-STEM data detailing gold nanoparticle growth.

- **Authors**: Swetha Pemma, Lena Langenohl, Saba Saood, Yoonji Choi, Rebecca Janisch, Christian H. Liebscher, Gerhard Dehm, Tobias Brink
- **Date**: 2026-01-23
- **Objective**: To understand how geometrically necessary defects (disconnections) influence the thermodynamic stability and phase transitions of grain boundary phases (complexions) at inclined, asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper ($\text{Cu}$).
- **Finding**: Defect energies were found to have a major influence on the stability of grain boundary phases, even at small inclinations. When defects are unable to accommodate large inclinations, the grain boundary facets into adjacent symmetric phases. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) experiments were used to analyze the disconnections in experimental $\text{Cu}$ and $\text{Al}$ samples, validating the simulation results regarding the role of these line defects.

- **Date**: 2026-01-23
- **Objective**: To mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur ($\text{Li-S}$) batteries by modifying polyethylene separators with synergistic coatings of ferromagnetic elements ($\text{Ni}$, $\text{Co}$) and the solid electrolyte $\text{Li}_{1.5}\text{Al}_{0.5}\text{Ge}_{1.5}(\text{PO}_4)_3$ (LAGP).
- **Finding**: The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the surface morphology and elemental composition of the pristine and modified separators.

**11. [Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15898v1)**
- **Authors**: Jehyeok Ryu, Victor Krivenkov, Vitaly Goryashko, Yury Rakovich, Alexey Y. Nikitin
- **Date**: 2026-01-22
- **Objective**: To suggest a methodology for reconstructing the intrinsic size-dependent complex dielectric permittivity of individual $\text{CsPbBr}_3$ perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) from ensemble absorbance spectra.
- **Finding**: The methodology successfully reconstructed the permittivity, yielding a spectral linewidth ($78.4 \text{ meV}$) consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths. The reconstructed permittivity is crucial for designing nanophotonic devices. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was essential for deriving the size distribution of the PNCs, which was used as input for the Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation model.

**12. [Effects of pulsed and continuous light and heavy ion irradiation on the morphology and electrical properties of Ag+C60 and Au+C60 composite thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15835v1)**
- **Authors**: Giovanni Ceccio, Kazumasa Takahashi, Yuto Kondo, Romana Miksova, Vasily Lavrentiev, Josef Novak, Eva Stepanovska, Jiri Vacik
- **Date**: 2026-01-22
- **Objective**: To elucidate the effects of continuous $\text{Ar}$ ion irradiation versus pulsed $\text{C}$ ion irradiation on the morphology and electrical properties of $\text{Ag}+\text{C}_{60}$ and $\text{Au}+\text{C}_{60}$ nanocomposite thin films.
- **Finding**: Continuous $\text{Ar}$ irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, resulting in highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces, and strongly affected the electrical resistance (especially for $\text{Au}+\text{C}_{60}$). In contrast, pulsed $\text{C}$ irradiation retained compact and homogeneous surface morphologies with minor changes in resistivity. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to examine and characterize these irradiation-induced morphological changes.

- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize films of few-layer reduced graphite oxide (RGO) functionalized by the zwitterionic surfactant DDPS using the Langmuir-Blodgett method, focusing on improving the degree of reduction and electrical conductivity.
- **Finding**: Functionalization of RGO with the zwitterionic surfactant improved the degrees of reduction and defect repair achieved by chemical reducing agents (hydrazine or vitamin C). This functionalization significantly increased the electrical conductivity of the resulting paper-like films. The quality and morphology of the RGO sheets were checked using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM).

**14. [Physicochemical properties of lunar regolith simulant for in situ oxygen production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14719v1)**
- **Authors**: Alyssa Ang De Guzman, Anish Mathai Varghese, Saif Alshalloudi, Lance Kosca, Kyriaki Polychronopoulou, Marko Gacesa
- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To validate and characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants (highlands and south pole) to assess their physicochemical properties and reduction behavior for *in situ* oxygen production.
- **Finding**: The simulants exhibited strong mineralogical and compositional fidelity to Apollo samples. While ilmenite is the most reducible phase, bulk highland simulants showed favorable reduction behavior due to distributed $\text{Fe}$-bearing silicate and glassy phases, and surface/microstructural properties influencing gas-solid interactions. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) coupled with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was used for detailed structural and elemental compositional analysis.

- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that epitaxial strain can induce a robust, intrinsic ferroelectric state in bulk cubic $\text{KTaO}_3$ thin films, resulting in a transition temperature above room temperature.
- **Finding**: $\text{KTaO}_3$ films grown on $\text{SrTiO}_3$ experienced compressive strain ($-2.1\%$), transforming the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with a transition temperature of $475 \text{ K}$. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) revealed cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns relative to the tantalum columns at room temperature, confirming the emergence of a global polar ground state described by the $4\text{mm}$ point group.

- **Authors**: Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Wei Lv, Xianfeng Wu, Guangdi Zhou, Zihao Nie, Yueying Li, Cui Ding, Danfeng Li, Hongtao Yuan, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To achieve continuous control over the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors using an *operando* monitored reduction (OMR) method to modulate $\text{Ni } 3d$ orbital electron occupancy.
- **Finding**: OMR enabled ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the $\text{Ni } 3d$ occupancy (from $\sim 3d^7$ to $\sim 3d^9$). The resulting SIT deviated from the canonical 2D model, exhibiting a mixture of 2D and 3D superconducting characters. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) Annular Bright Field (ABF) analysis was crucial for systematically calibrating the oxygen atom positions and linking structural changes to the modulated $\text{Ni } 3d$ occupancy.

**17. [Nanoparticle Self-assembly Assisted by Polymers: The Role of Shear Stress in the Nanoparticle Arrangement of Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13842v1)**
- **Authors**: Beatriz Martín-García, M. Mercedes Velázquez
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To investigate how shear stress, applied via compression-expansion cycles, influences the self-assembly and resulting morphology of $\text{CdSe}$ quantum dots (QDs) within mixed Langmuir monolayers with a block copolymer.
- **Finding**: Shear stress induced by $50$ compression-expansion cycles drove the QDs out of metastable states into a new, more ordered equilibrium state. Increased strain amplitude resulted in smaller QD domain sizes and more ordered Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to analyze the morphology and arrangement of the QDs in the transferred LB films.

- **Authors**: Miran Joo, Huixin Xiu, Sabrina Baha, Ridha Zerdoumi, Ningyan Cheng, Christoph Somsen, Yujiao Li, Aleksander Kostka, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Alfred Ludwig, Christina Scheu
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To investigate the correlation between Ruthenium ($\text{Ru}$) content, microstructural complexity, defect formation, and electrocatalytic activity in $\text{Au-Pd-Pt-Ru}$ compositionally complex solid solution (CCSS) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing $\text{Ru}$ content caused lattice contraction and a transition in defect structure from high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity improved with higher $\text{Ru}$ content. Electron microscopy equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) provided high-throughput compositional and structural characterization, while Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed local element-specific enrichment/depletion at grain boundaries.

**19. [Near-atomic investigation on the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nano-sized kappa phase and B2 phase in an Al-alloyed lightweight steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13721v1)**
- **Authors**: Bowen Zou, Yixu Wang, Xiao Shen, Philipp Krooss, Thomas Niendorf, Richard Dronskowski, Wenwen Song
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To reveal the elemental redistribution mechanisms during the co-precipitation of nanosized $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ phases within the FCC matrix of an $\text{Al}$-alloyed lightweight steel.
- **Finding**: Two co-nanoprecipitation modes were identified. Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed that the $\text{B}2$ phase next to $\kappa$ (B2I) was $\text{FeAl}$-type, while isolated $\text{B}2$ (B2II) was $\text{NiAl}$-type. Density Functional Theory (DFT) confirmed that $\text{Fe-Ni}$ atomic exchange between $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ is thermodynamically favorable, driving the $\text{B}2$ phase evolution and improving the stability of both phases. Correlative Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Transmission Electron Microscopy (TKD-TEM) was used for structural and orientation analysis of the nanosized precipitates.

**20. [Towards reliable electrical measurements of superconducting devices inside a transmission electron microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13298v1)**
- **Authors**: Joachim Dahl Thomsen, Michael I. Faley, Joseph Vimal Vas, Alexander Clausen, Thibaud Denneulin, Dominik Biscette, Denys Sutter, Peng-Han Lu, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To demonstrate reliable electrical transport measurements of superconducting devices (niobium nitride, $\text{NbN}$) inside a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder.
- **Finding**: By optimizing a thermal radiation shield, a base sample temperature of $8-9 \text{ K}$ was achieved, close to the superconducting transition temperature of $\text{NbN}$. It was found that both electron beam imaging and the magnetic field of the objective lens perturb the superconducting state. This capability establishes a platform for correlative low-temperature TEM studies, linking structural, spectroscopic, and electrical transport data from the same quantum device.

**21. [Discovery of Ferroelectric Twin Boundaries in a Photoactive Halide Perovskite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12892v1)**
- **Authors**: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To discover and characterize the existence and nature of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited photoactive $\text{CsPbI}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Ferroelastic twin boundaries parallel to $\{110\}$ and $\{112\}$ planes were discovered. Low-dose Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) directly observed that $\text{Pb}$ atoms shift at the $\{110\}$ twin boundaries, driving a local ferroelectric-like polarization, despite the bulk material being centrosymmetric. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, opening opportunities for domain wall engineering in halide perovskites.

- **Authors**: Soumi Mondal, Sreekant Anil, Saurav Islam, Yingdong Guan, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Aaron Pearre, Sandra Santhosh, Nasim Alem, Nitin Samarth, Zhiqiang Mao
- **Date**: 2026-01-18
- **Objective**: To synthesize high-quality $\alpha$-$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ single crystals with significantly reduced carrier density by utilizing a $\text{Se}$-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique.
- **Finding**: The modified Bridgman technique successfully produced pure $\alpha$-$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ single crystals with $3\text{R}$ stacking. These crystals exhibited a remarkably low carrier density of $1.5-3.2 \times 10^{16} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ at $300 \text{ K}$, indicating effective suppression of $\text{Se}$-vacancies relative to conventional methods. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the structural purity and stoichiometry of the grown crystals.

- **Date**: 2026-01-17
- **Objective**: To study the electric charge transport mechanisms and dielectric properties of $\text{BaTiO}_3$ ceramics synthesized by Spark-Plasma Sintering (SPS) with varying carbon impurity content.
- **Finding**: The SPS ceramics exhibit colossal relative dielectric permittivity (up to $10^5 - 10^6$). Conduction is determined by the Mott variable range hopping mechanism. Increased carbon concentration led to simultaneous decreases in permittivity and resistivity in the hopping conduction range, consistent with the Heywang model. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to estimate the concentration and distribution of the carbon impurity within the samples.

Successful Van der Waals epitaxy of $\text{MnSb}_2\text{Te}_4$ thin films over amorphous $\text{SiO}_x$ using $\text{Sb}_2\text{Te}_3$ seeds was achieved. High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-STEM) combined with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was essential for identifying the anisotropic anti-site distribution and confirming the epitaxy of the thin films.

- **Authors**: William Thornley, Sam Sullivan-Allsop, Rongsheng Cai, Nick Clark, Roman Gorbachev, Sarah J. Haigh
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and quantify the effectiveness of the Noise2Void deep learning technique for denoising atomic-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images and videos.
- **Finding**: The Noise2Void technique successfully denoised atomic-resolution STEM data, qualitatively improving the visibility of both $\mathrm{Au}$ adatoms and the graphene lattice in liquid cell experiments. Quantitatively, the approach significantly outperformed traditional denoising methods like total variation and simple Gaussian blurring, while maintaining compatibility with real-time data acquisition rates (at least $45$ frames per second) without requiring manual intervention or prior sample knowledge.

- **Authors**: Hao-Jin Wang, Liqun Shen, Xin-Ning Tian, Lei Lei, Kexin Wang, Grigore Moldovan, Marc-Georg Willinger, Zhu-Jun Wang
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To develop a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that integrates a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning for quantitative 3D and 4D nanometrology.
- **Finding**: The framework achieves single-shot, quantitative $3\mathrm{D}$ nanometrology with precision comparable to atomic force microscopy but at significantly higher throughput. By establishing an end-to-end, self-supervised optimization loop, it enforces physical consistency. This synergy enabled $4\mathrm{D}$ (*3D* real space plus time) *in situ* characterization, revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics during copper redox processes invisible to conventional Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

**28. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To comprehensively analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in $\mathrm{Si}/\mathrm{Fe}$ bilayers as the $\mathrm{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{Fe}$) is varied, focusing on the role of the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and other structural data revealed a percolation-driven transition when $t_{Fe}$ fell below $30 \text{ \AA}$, changing the film from continuous metallic to a percolative network structure. This structural evolution drove a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism, shifting from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution ($n \sim 1.42$) in thick films to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism ($n = 0.62$) in high-resistive, percolative films.

**29. [Absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 revealed by X-ray linear dichroism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06791v1)**
- **Authors**: Siyu Wang, Chao Wang, Yanan Yuan, Jiangxiao Li, Fangfang Pei, Daxiang Liu, Chunyu Qin, Jiefeng Cao, Yamei Wang, Tianye Wang, Jiayu Liu, Jieun Lee, Guanhua Zhang, Christoph Klewe, Chenchao Yu, Fan Zhang, Dongsheng Song, Kai Chen, Weisheng Zhao, Dawei Shen, Ziqiang Qiu, Mengmeng Yang, Bin Hong, Qian Li
- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To use X-ray linear dichroism (XLD) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) to determine the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ films, a proposed altermagnetic candidate.
- **Finding**: The observed XLD signal was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field direction, strongly contrasting with the substantial magnetic order-related XLD signal predicted by multiple scattering calculations. This evidence unequivocally demonstrates the absence of magnetic order in $\mathrm{RuO}_2$. Distinct XLD signals at the $\mathrm{Ru}$ $\mathrm{M}_3$ and $\mathrm{O}$ $\mathrm{K}$ edges were attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field.

- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\mathrm{nm}$-scale $\alpha\text{-}\mathrm{Mn}$ precipitates in an ultrafine-grained $\mathrm{Mg}\text{-}\mathrm{Mn}$ alloy during high-pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature.
- **Finding**: The volume fraction of $\alpha\text{-}\mathrm{Mn}$ particles increased with applied strain, but Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that the majority of $\mathrm{Mn}$ remained in solution. Analysis of the precipitate size distribution determined that the mean particle size did not increase during HPT, suggesting that precipitate growth was limited by interfacial control rather than diffusional control. *EM Contribution:* Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was used to analyze the precipitate size distribution and microstructure.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analysis of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) in $\mathrm{Nb}$ and $\mathrm{Ta}$-encapsulated $\mathrm{Nb}$ thin films relevant to superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Oxygen segregation was observed at GBs in both $\mathrm{Nb}$ and $\mathrm{Ta}/\mathrm{Nb}$ films, with the level of segregation correlating positively with the oxygen concentration within the grains. The oxygen enrichment factor ($\mathrm{C}_{gb}/\mathrm{C}_{grain}$) for $\mathrm{Nb}$ was $2.7$, slightly reduced in $\mathrm{Ta}$-capped films ($2.3$). Increased oxygen concentration in both grains and GBs correlated with a suppression of the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$). *EM Contribution:* Atom-Probe Tomography (APT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to provide atomic-scale chemical and structural insights into oxygen segregation at the GBs.

- **Authors**: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To investigate how graded structural heterogeneity in functionally graded materials (FGMs) influences and enhances transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion (the anomalous Ettingshausen effect).

The surface enthalpy was determined to be $4.79 \pm 0.45 \text{ J m}^{-2}$, a large value comparable to forsterite, suggesting a barrier to nucleation in planetary environments. The methodology successfully separated surface and interfacial contributions to the energetics. *EM Contribution:* Electron microscopy was used to characterize the size and morphology of the synthesized enstatite nanoparticles.

- **Finding**: *In situ* visualization showed that while both geometries followed similar nucleation sequences, the evolving $\alpha/\beta\text{-}\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibited geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. Nanocubes maintained $\{100\}$-aligned interfaces (consistent with static elastic equilibrium), whereas nanoplates displayed $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces, demonstrating that geometry dictates the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways far from equilibrium. *EM Contribution:* *In situ* liquid phase Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) provided direct visualization of the structural dynamics and interfacial evolution during the hydrogenation process at the nanoscale.

- **Finding**: The machine-learned potentials provided higher fidelity descriptions than previous empirical models, predicting enhanced peak defect production and recombination during cascade evolution. Total defect production was found to depend only weakly on oxygen stoichiometry. Simulations of $300 \text{ keV}$ cascades revealed the formation of amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length. *EM Contribution:* The simulation results are consistent with prior electron microscopy observations of radiation damage in neutron-irradiated high-temperature superconducting tapes, validating the predictive power of the new computational models.
