**1. [A new angle on stacking faults: Breaking the edge-on limit in high-resolution defect analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15510v1)**
- **Authors**: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas Müller, Andreas Bezold, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Objective**: Introduce a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method to enable full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals, overcoming the conventional edge-on limitation.
- **Finding**: A novel HRSTEM method was developed that allows for comprehensive structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults, eliminating a long-standing geometric constraint in high-resolution analysis. This approach provides access to stacking faults on all glide planes along widely used [001] and [110] zone axes. The method's robustness was demonstrated in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination even in overlapping configurations and thick foils. Simulations revealed that fault-induced de-channeling is crucial for contrast formation, leading to a technique for artificially generating ultrathin TEM lamellae bounded by stacking faults, which enhances contrast for atomic-scale studies.

**2. [Strongly coupled interface ferroelectricity and interface superconductivity in LAO/KTO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15062v1)**
- **Authors**: M. D. Dong, X. B. Cheng, M. Zhang, J. Wu
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Objective**: Discover and investigate the coexistence and coupling of ferroelectric and superconducting orders at the interface of LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$(111) (LAO/KTO).
- **Finding**: Ferroelectric order was discovered at the LAO/KTO interface, where it coexists with superconductivity. Manipulating this interface ferroelectricity was shown to change interfacial conductivity by over 1000 times, simultaneously causing the diminishing and reappearance of superconductivity due to strong coupling. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the ferroelectricity by revealing K ion displacements relative to Ta ions, aided by oxygen vacancies at the LAO/KTO interface. The resultant electric polarization was locally switchable, and its hysteresis correlated with changes in interfacial conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$).

**3. [Polarization switching on the open surfaces of the wurtzite ferroelectric nitrides: ferroelectric subsystems and electrochemical reactivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14452v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongtao Liu, Anton V. Ievlev, Eugene A. Eliseev, Nana Sun, Kazuki Okamoto, Hiroshi Funakubo, Anna N. Morozovska, Sergei Kalinin
- **Date**: 2025-06-17
- **Objective**: Explore the polarization switching mechanisms in binary wurtzite ferroelectric nitrides, focusing on the presence of ferroelectric subsystems and bias-induced electrochemical reactivity on their open surfaces.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated the presence of two weakly coupled ferroelectric subsystems and bias-induced electrochemical reactivity during polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric nitrides. Multidimensional high-resolution piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy were employed to detect the evolution of induced ferroelectric domains, electromechanical response, and surface deformation. These PFM-based observations are highly consistent with recent electron microscopy observations of "shark-teeth like" ferroelectric domains in nitrides, establishing a universal phenomenological picture of polarization switching in these materials.

- **Authors**: Cecilia Granados-Miralles, Matilde Saura-Múzquiz, Espen D. Bøjesen, Kirsten M. Ø. Jensen, Henrik L. Andersen, Mogens Christensen
- **Date**: 2025-06-17
- **Objective**: Follow the hydrothermal synthesis of magnetic strontium hexaferrite ($SrFe_{12}O_{19}$) nanocrystallites in situ using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction to unravel their structural and magnetic information.
- **Finding**: The formation of $SrFe_{12}O_{19}$ was found to occur through an intermediate crystalline phase, identified as six-line ferrihydrite (FeOOH), which significantly influences the magnetic properties of the final material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was combined with Rietveld refinements of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data to confirm the hexagonal platelet morphology of $SrFe_{12}O_{19}$. Room temperature magnetization curves were measured on the prepared nanopowders, and the magnetic properties were discussed in the context of phase composition and crystallite size.

- **Authors**: Shivani Sharma, Pooja Jain, Benny Schundelmier, Chin-Wei Wang, Poonam Yadav, Adrienn Maria Szucs, Kaya Wei, N. P. Lalla, Theo Siegrist
- **Date**: 2025-06-16
- **Objective**: Conduct a comprehensive study of the $Ge_{1-x}Mn_xCo_2O_4$ (GMCO) system to understand the influence of Mn substitution on its crystal and magnetic structure at low temperatures.
- **Finding**: Phase separation was observed in GMCO ($Ge_{0.5}Mn_{0.5}Co_2O_4$), consisting predominantly of a Mn-rich primary phase and a minor Ge-rich secondary phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDX analysis was crucial in revealing the approximate stoichiometries of these distinct phases ($Mn_{0.74}Ge_{0.18}Co_2O_4$ and $Ge_{0.91}Mn_{0.19}Co_2O_4$). Significant differences in low-temperature structural properties were observed, with the Mn-rich phase exhibiting ferrimagnetic ordering and the Ge-rich phase showing antiferromagnetic order, indicating suppressed magneto-structural coupling due to the inhomogeneities.

- **Authors**: Inger-Emma Nylund, Elise R. Eilertsen, Constantinos A. Hatzoglou, Kaja Eggen Aune, Ruben Bjørge, Antonius T. J. van Helvoort, Ann Mari Svensson, Paraskevas Kontis
- **Date**: 2025-06-16
- **Objective**: Provide atomic-scale insights into grain boundary segregation in the Co-free pristine spinel $LiNi_{0.5}Mn_{1.5}O_4$ cathode material.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) were employed to study grain boundary segregation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) revealed the segregation of Mn and depletion of Ni at grain boundaries, which was corroborated by APT, further showing segregation of O and depletion of Li. Both methods also identified the segregation of Na, an impurity. Additionally, segregation of O and Mn, and depletion of Li, were observed at dislocations, providing further support for the segregation behavior at grain boundaries. These near-atomic-scale observations offer new insights for improving Li-ion battery materials.

**7. [Direct visualization of visible-light hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in real space and time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13719v1)**
- **Authors**: Atreyie Ghosh, Calvin Raab, Joseph L. Spellberg, Aishani Mohan, Sarah B. King
- **Date**: 2025-06-16
- **Objective**: Achieve the first direct real-space and real-time visualization of visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in natural materials.
- **Finding**: The first direct real-space and real-time visualization of hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in molybdenum(IV) oxychloride ($MoOCl_2$) was achieved using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). This technique provided femtosecond time resolution and nanometer spatial resolution, enabling the measurement of HPP propagation velocities and lengths, real-time observation of plasmon-material edge interactions, experimental validation of hyperbolic dispersion through polarization-dependent experiments, and direct visualization of hyperbolic focusing phenomena. This spatiotemporal visualization validates theoretical predictions and establishes an experimental foundation for exploiting these unusual light-matter states.

**8. [Extrinsic Dopants as Growth Modifiers in Cu-Cr-O delafossites: A Study of Incorporation Limits and Film Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13540v1)**
- **Authors**: Marco Moreira, Yves Fleming, Patrick Grysan, Christele Vergne, Adrian Marie Philippe, Petru Lunca-Popa
- **Date**: 2025-06-16
- **Objective**: Investigate how various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) influence the structure and properties of Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that films grown on c-plane sapphire were epitaxial near the substrate interface but relaxed into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon were polycrystalline throughout. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that actual dopant incorporation was well below the nominal 5 at.%, with only Al and Sc present above detection. Despite limited dopant incorporation, subtle structural and optical shifts were observed, suggesting that dopant precursor chemistry and growth conditions significantly influence film stoichiometry and properties.

**9. [Designing artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by altering the chain length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13808v1)**
- **Authors**: Sebastian Lellig, Subisha Balakumar, Peter Schweizer, Eva P. Mayer, Simon Evertz, Marcus Hans, Damian M. Holzapfel, Yin Du, Qing Zhou, Martin Dienwiebel, Johann Michler, Jochen M. Schneider
- **Date**: 2025-06-13
- **Objective**: Design artificial sulfur-free zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by altering their chain length through thermal annealing.
- **Finding**: Sputtered zinc phosphate coatings, initially classified as metaphosphates, showed reduced chain lengths as the annealing temperature increased, indicated by XPS data showing a loss of phosphorus and oxygen from the coating surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line scans confirmed that this composition change occurred over the entire thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length reduction resulted in a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and improved wear resistance, demonstrating that the properties of artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via thermally stimulated composition changes.

**10. [Kinetics of Amorphous Defect Phases Measured Through Ultrafast Nanocalorimetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12179v1)**
- **Authors**: W. Streit Cunningham, Tianjiao Lei, Hannah C. Howard, Timothy J Rupert, Daniel S. Gianola
- **Date**: 2025-06-13
- **Objective**: Explore the kinetics of grain boundary confined amorphous defect phases in Al-based nanocrystalline alloys using ultrafast differential scanning calorimetry.
- **Finding**: Ultrafast differential scanning calorimetry was utilized to apply targeted annealing/quenching treatments at high rates, capable of capturing the kinetic behavior of amorphous defect phases. Correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was applied to link phase evolution and grain stability to nanocalorimetry signatures. A critical cooling rate of 2,400 $^\circ C/s$ was determined for the grain boundary confined disordered-to-ordered transition in the Al-Ni system. The study also demonstrated remarkable microstructural stability after 1,000 repeated annealing sequences, contributing to a deeper understanding of grain boundary localized thermodynamics and kinetics.

**11. [From stripes to hexagons: strain-induced 2D Pb phases confined between graphene and SiC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10791v1)**
- **Authors**: Markus Gruschwitz, Sergii Sologub, Chitran Ghosal, Zamin Mamiyev, Yuran Niu, Alexei Zakharov, Christoph Tegenkamp
- **Date**: 2025-06-12
- **Objective**: Investigate the intercalation process of Pb beneath graphene on SiC(0001) to understand the formation of novel two-dimensional (2D) Pb phases.
- **Finding**: The intercalation process was investigated across multiple length scales using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and various microscopy techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM). The analysis revealed the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, depending on local coverage. These findings provide new insights into the strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers and highlight graphene's potential as a versatile platform for engineering low-dimensional materials.

**12. [Studying all-optical magnetization switching of GdFe by double-pulse laser excitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10450v1)**
- **Authors**: Rahil Hosseinifar, Felix Steinbach, Ivar Kumberg, José Miguel Lendínez, Sangeeta Thakur, Sebastien E. Hadjadj, Jendrik Gördes, Chowdhury S. Awsaf, Mario Fix, Manfred Albrecht, Florian Kronast, Unai Atxitia, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Wolfgang Kuch
- **Date**: 2025-06-12
- **Objective**: Investigate the speed and frequency limits of all-optical magnetization switching in a GdFe ferrimagnetic alloy using double-pulse laser excitation.
- **Finding**: The effects of varying fluences and time delays between two laser pulses on GdFe magnetization switching were explored using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and Kerr microscopy for magnetic domain imaging. It was found that when the first pulse fluence was just above the switching threshold, a second pulse with about 60% of the fluence, arriving only 3 ps later, could switch the magnetization back, persisting up to about 40 ps. For shorter delays below 2 ps, the pulses' effects added up, enabling switching at fluences below the single-pulse threshold. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations successfully confirmed the experimental data.

**13. [Designing Corrosion-Resistant CoCrNi Medium Entropy Alloys via Short-Range Order Modification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09951v1)**
- **Authors**: Elaf A. Anber, Debashish Sur, Annie K. Barnett, Daniel L. Foley, Andrew M. Minor, Brian L. DeCost, Howie Joress, Anatoly I. Frenkel, Michael L. Falk, John R. Scully, Mitra L. Taheri
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: Explore the evolution of chemical short-range order (CSRO) and its correlation with passive film formation and corrosion resistance in equiatomic CoCrNi medium entropy alloys.
- **Finding**: The study combined extended x-ray absorption fine structure, atomistic simulations, electrochemical methods, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate CSRO evolution and passive film characteristics. Results revealed a shift in local alloying element bonding environments post-aging, with simulations indicating increased Cr-Cr CSRO in 2nd nearest neighbor shells. Enhanced passive film formation kinetics and superior protection of the aged alloy in harsh environments correlated with the increased Cr-Cr CSRO, establishing a direct connection between alloy CSRO and aqueous passivation.

**14. [Rock-salt ScN(113) layers grown on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09715v1)**
- **Authors**: Duc V. Dinh, Esperanza Luna, Oliver Brandt
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: Report the growth and characterization of rock-salt ScN(113) layers on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$$(10\bar{1}0)$ templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy.
- **Finding**: The growth and characterization of (85-210)-nm-thick undoped ScN layers were successfully achieved. X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed a pure (113) surface orientation with rotational twins. Two distinct in-plane relationships between ScN(113) and AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ were identified: the dominant $[1\bar{1}0]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[33\bar{2}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$, and a less prevalent one. Broad photoluminescence spectra with a peak emission energy of $\approx 2.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ originated from the lowest direct gap at the $\mathbf{X}$ point of the ScN band structure, and temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements revealed impurity band conduction.

**15. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: Explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and identify approaches to optimize $Z$ sensitivity.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that ptychography's $Z$-dependence is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column. A monotonic $Z$-dependence was observed when integrating over a small region, but it became significantly non-monotonic and followed trends in the orbital shell-structure when the integration area was increased. The reconstructed projected potential aligned well with the transmission function. This non-monotonic $Z$-dependence was shown to be useful for accentuating contrast between certain elements, allowing distinguishability of elements differing by only a single atomic number (e.g., $\beta$-CuZn) even in thick samples ($>20$ nm).

- **Date**: 2025-06-10
- **Objective**: Propose a comprehensive first-principle atomistic approach to predict the Wulff-Kaischew equilibrium shape of crystals heterogeneously integrated on a dissimilar material.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive first-principle atomistic approach was proposed that uses reconstructed surface and interface absolute energies, determined by density functional theory, to infer the morphology and wetting properties of Volmer-Weber islands. The predicted equilibrium shapes of GaP crystals heterogeneously grown on Si were found to be in good agreement with experimental observations performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). This method provides a powerful tool for the optimization of hetero-structured, multifunctional, and smart materials and devices.

- **Authors**: Mads Weile, Sergii Grytsiuk, Aubrey Penn, Daniel G. Chica, Xavier Roy, Kseniia Mosina, Zdenek Sofer, Jakob Schiøtz, Stig Helveg, Malte Rösner, Frances M. Ross, Julian Klein
- **Date**: 2025-06-09
- **Objective**: Establish a comprehensive defect library in a bilayer of the magnetic quasi-1D semiconductor CrSBr by combining atomic-resolution imaging, deep learning, and ab-initio calculations.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive defect library in bilayer CrSBr was established. A custom-developed machine learning workflow was applied to detect, classify, and average point vacancy defects using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This classification enabled the uncovering of several distinct Cr interstitial defect complexes, combined Cr and Br vacancy defect complexes, and lines of vacancy defects extending over many unit cells. Their occurrence was consistent with computed structures and binding energy densities, reflecting the intriguing layer interlocked crystal structure of CrSBr.

**18. [Probing Millikelvin Temperature Sensitivity in Chiral Nanoparticles via Optical Forces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06641v1)**
- **Authors**: Seongmin Im, Wei Hong, Gayatri Chandran, Xing Wang, Yang Zhao
- **Date**: 2025-06-07
- **Objective**: Investigate the origin of photothermal force, enable nanoscale mapping, and evaluate temperature sensitivity using tip-based optical force nanoscopy.
- **Finding**: Tip-based optical force nanoscopy combined with phase-informed decomposition was employed to investigate photothermal effects in chiral nanoparticles. The system achieved a temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.1 K without needing an additional temperature-sensitive layer, making it well-suited for nanoscale photothermal mapping under ambient conditions. While electron microscopy is mentioned as a technique limited by vacuum conditions, this study's primary contribution is the development and demonstration of a versatile tip-based optical force platform for localized thermal effect investigations.

**19. [Imaging 3D polarization dynamics via deep learning 4D-STEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06598v1)**
- **Authors**: Jinho Byun, Keeyong Lee, Myoungho Jeong, Eunha Lee, Jeongil Bang, Haeryong Kim, Geun Ho Gu, Sang Ho Oh
- **Date**: 2025-06-07
- **Objective**: Present a deep learning framework combined with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to reconstruct 3D polarization maps in ferroelectric thin-film capacitors.
- **Finding**: A deep learning framework was presented that, when combined with 4D-STEM, enables the reconstruction of 3D polarization maps in $Ba_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}TiO_3$ thin-film capacitors with picometer-level accuracy under applied electric fields. This approach allowed for the observation of polar nanodomains consistent with the polar slush model and revealed that polarization switching occurs through coordinated vector rotation toward $<111>$ energy minima, rather than magnitude changes. Furthermore, regions with higher topological density exhibited smaller polarization variation, indicating topological protection.

- **Authors**: Fei Wang, Qiaohui Zhou, Hong Tang, Fan Zhang, Yanxing Li, Ana M Sanchez, Keyuan Bai, Sidra Younus, Chih-Kang Shih, Adrienn Ruzsinszky, Xin Lu, Jiang Wei
- **Date**: 2025-06-06
- **Objective**: Unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes.
- **Finding**: Unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors were unveiled in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes using angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) directly visualized the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Raman investigations revealed remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviated significantly from conventional behavior, attributed to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions.

- **Objective**: Elucidate dielectric losses, structural heterogeneity, and interface imperfections in superconducting qubits using noninvasive terahertz (THz) nano-imaging/-spectroscopy.
- **Finding**: Noninvasive terahertz (THz) nano-imaging/-spectroscopy of encapsulated niobium transmon qubits was demonstrated, revealing sidewall near-field scattering that correlates with qubit coherence. A THz hyperspectral line scan was further employed to probe dielectric responses and field participation at Al junction interfaces. These findings highlight the promise of THz near-field methods as a high-throughput proxy characterization tool for guiding material selection and optimizing processing protocols to improve qubit and quantum circuit performance, offering an alternative to destructive electron microscopy or low-throughput millikelvin quantum measurements.

- **Finding**: An end-to-end post-processing framework for large-scale 4D-STEM datasets was introduced, built around a highly efficient neural network-based object detection model. Central to the method is a sub-pixel accurate object center localization algorithm, which serves as the foundation for high-precision and high-throughput analysis of electron diffraction patterns. The framework demonstrated a strain measurement precision of $5 \times 10^{-4}$ within the strain-free Si substrate of a Si/SiGe multilayer TEM sample and achieved speeds exceeding 100 frames per second, substantially accelerating crystallographic phase identification and strain mapping.

**23. [Interfacial Energy Gradients Drive Coalescence of Supported Nanoparticles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04455v1)**
- **Authors**: Cheng-Yu Chen, Duncan Burns, Peter W. Voorhees, Eric A. Stach
- **Date**: 2025-06-04
- **Objective**: Investigate the coalescence behavior of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles on dynamically evolving, heterogeneous silicon nitride ($SiN_x$) substrates.
- **Finding**: In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to investigate platinum (Pt) nanoparticle dynamics on $SiN_x$ substrates where localized crystalline silicon (Si) nanodomains were deliberately formed. It was observed that Pt nanoparticles in contact with these Si pads transformed into a more mobile platinum silicide ($Pt_3Si$) phase. Strikingly, these $Pt_3Si$ nanoparticles exhibited pronounced directional migration away from the Si pads, driven by interfacial energy gradients, fundamentally dictating coalescence pathways. This work reveals how local substrate chemistry and resulting interfacial energy landscapes can dominate over initial particle size or proximity in controlling solid-state nanoparticle migration and assembly.

- **Authors**: Seokjo Hong, Jaewhan Oh, Woohyun Cho, Soyoung Lee, Colin Ophus, Yeongkwan Kim, Heejun Yang, SungBin Lee, Yongsoo Yang
- **Date**: 2025-06-03
- **Objective**: Map the spatial distribution of charge density wave (CDW) superlattice intensities and analyze their autocorrelations in 2H-$NbSe_2$ to extract the temperature-dependent correlation length of the local CDW order parameter.
- **Finding**: Cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) measurements of CDW ordering in 2H-$NbSe_2$ were reported, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling down to 20 K. By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter was extracted, independent of global phase coherence. Results revealed weak short-range amplitude correlations persisting above the transition temperature and growing significantly upon cooling, demonstrating 4D-STEM as a powerful tool for probing spatially inhomogeneous electronic order in quantum materials.

**25. [Energy Time Ptychography for one-dimensional phase retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00492v1)**
- **Authors**: Ankita Negi, Leon Merten Lohse, Sven Velten, Ilya Sergeev, Olaf Leupold, Sakshath Sadashivaiah, Dimitrios Bessas, Aleksandr Chumakhov, Christina Brandt, Lars Bocklage, Guido Meier, Ralf Röhlsberger
- **Date**: 2025-05-31
- **Objective**: Address a one-dimensional phase problem linking energy and time, which arises in X-ray scattering from ultrasharp nuclear resonances, for extracting spectral information from a single measurement.
- **Finding**: A robust approach similar to ptychographic phase retrieval in imaging was proposed, which uses multiple energetically overlapping measurements to retrieve both the transmission spectrum and the phase of the scattering response. This method leverages the M\"ossbauer effect, where nuclei scatter radiation without energy loss, and nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron X-ray pulses in the time domain, providing superior sensitivity and faster data acquisition. This approach can overcome the bandwidth limitations of traditional gamma-ray sources, opening new research directions with modern X-ray sources and M\"ossbauer isotopes.

**26. [Influence of X-ray Irradiation on the Magnetic and Structural Properties of Gadolinium Silicide Nanoparticles for Self-Regulating Hyperthermia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00293v1)**
-   **Authors**: Samantha E. Smith, Santiago Bermudez, Pavan Chaitanya, Zoe Boekelheide, Jessika Rojas Marin, Ravi L. Hadimani
-   **Date**: 2025-05-30
-   **Objective**: To investigate the impact of high-dose X-ray irradiation on the magnetic and structural properties of gadolinium silicide ($Gd_5Si_4$) nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia treatment (MHT) and deep-space applications.
-   **Finding**: While X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed no structural or compositional changes, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed localized lattice distortions. These distortions correlated with observable changes in magnetic properties (magnetization vs. temperature and hysteresis), though magnetocaloric properties and specific loss power (SLP) remained unaffected, confirming $Gd_5Si_4$'s stability under high-dose X-ray irradiation.

**27. [Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176v1)**
-   **Authors**: J. M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
-   **Date**: 2025-05-30
-   **Objective**: To study the structural relaxation and medium-range order (MRO) in self-ion implanted amorphous silicon (a-Si) using fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM).
-   **Finding**: Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in self-ion implanted a-Si, which first increased then decreased upon thermal annealing before recrystallization, supporting the paracrystalline (PC) model over the continuous random network (CRN) model. At high ion doses, a high defect density was found in the PC phase, which annealed out at 500°C, resulting in a metastable, highly-ordered PC structure independent of initial implantation conditions.

-   **Authors**: Christoph Flathmann, Ulrich Ross, Jürgen Belz, Andreas Beyer, Kerstin Volz, Michael Seibt, Tobias Meyer
-   **Date**: 2025-05-29
-   **Objective**: To present a novel sequential tilting approach for 4D-STEM to improve momentum-resolved STEM (MRSTEM) field mapping, especially for subtle electric and magnetic fields.
-   **Finding**: The sequential tilting 4D-STEM approach, which records a full diffraction pattern for each tilt and spatial position, requires no hardware modification and allows for optimized beam tilt patterns. This method enables the creation of virtual large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (vLACBED) patterns from the acquired 4D-STEM data, which can be used to assess data quality and improve field measurements beyond simple averaging.

-   **Authors**: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
-   **Date**: 2025-05-19
-   **Objective**: To elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in $La_3Ni_2O_7$ using density functional theory calculations, focusing on structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics.

-   **Date**: 2025-05-19
-   **Objective**: To investigate the superconductivity and phase diagram of $Sr^{2+}$-doped $La_{3-x}Sr_{x}Ni_2O_7$ thin films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy, exploring the effect of heterovalent doping on $T_c$.

-   **Date**: 2025-05-14
-   **Objective**: To propose and validate strategies for improving the accuracy and robustness of aberration correction in single sideband (SSB) electron ptychography under low-dose conditions, which is often sensitive to noise due to phase unwrapping.
-   **Finding**: Two strategies were proposed: confining phase unwrapping within the sidebands and selecting only well-unwrapped sidebands for calculating aberration coefficients. These strategies were validated through SSB reconstructions of simulated and experimental 4D-STEM datasets of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($WSe_2$). The comparison demonstrated significant improvements in Poisson noise tolerance, making aberration correction more robust and reliable for low-dose imaging in electron ptychography.

-   **Objective**: To image and characterize domain boundaries and defect states in rubrene thin crystallites, focusing on orthorhombic crystalline morphologies, using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopy.
-   **Finding**: PEEM images revealed dominant emission localized at domain boundaries in a 2-photon photoemission (2PPE) process, indicating strong contributions from trap states, while 1-photon photoemission (1PPE) showed uniform emission. In the intermediate photon energy range, a nonlinear, non-integer photon order was identified where primarily the triclinic morphology contributed to emission, distinguishing it from the orthorhombic phase. These findings provide a new framework for assessing the quality and internal structure of organic semiconductor thin films.
