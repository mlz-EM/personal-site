-   **Authors**: Shamail Ahmed, Federico Rossi, Hanyu Huo, Johannes Haust, Franziska Hueppe, Juergen Belz, Andreas Beyer, Juergen Janek, Kerstin Volz
-   **Date**: 2025-07-22
-   **Objective**: To investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling.
-   **Finding**: Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that after the first lithiation, the electrode showed a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li$_{15}$Si$_{4}$, various amorphous Li$_{x}$Si phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure was more uniform, indicating that a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles.
