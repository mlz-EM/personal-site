-   **Authors**: Hitoshi Makino, Bernd Rellinghaus, Sebastian Schneider, Axel Lubk, Darius Pohl
-   **Date**: 2025-10-28
-   **Objective**: Present a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) measurements in transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
-   **Finding**: A comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD was developed and demonstrated on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, the study systematically analyzed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and identified detector-amplified shot noise as the dominant noise source, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras. This work advances the reliability of EMCD as a quantitative tool for nanoscale magnetic characterization by providing a framework for improved error handling and SNR optimization, ensuring critical spectral features like the Fe-$\text{L}_{2,3}$ peaks meet requirements for quantitative analysis.

-   **Finding**: X-ray fluorescence intensity correlations, excited by ultrashort X-ray pulses, contain 3D structural information of non-periodic, stationary objects. In the experiment, a vanadium foil was illuminated within a sub-200 nm X-ray laser beam focus, and 16 distinct specimen projections were recorded from different detector regions without changing sample orientation. The systematic variation of projections as the fluorescing volume translated confirmed that FEL-induced fluorescence reflects real-space structural changes, establishing a new method for lensless 3D imaging with broad implications for materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology.

**6. [Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moirés](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042v1)**
-   **Authors**: Harikrishnan KP, Xin Wei, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Ruijuan Xu, Jong-Hoon Kang, Ce Liang, Jiwoong Park, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
-   **Date**: 2025-10-27
-   **Objective**: Characterize the morphology of buried interfaces in twisted oxide moirés, highlighting the challenges posed by topographic mismatch and the need for reliable characterization methods.
-   **Finding**: Topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at buried interfaces, even after eliminating contaminants and amorphous interlayers. Cross-sectional imaging is necessary to characterize interface morphology and corroborate investigations of interlayer coupling. While conventional through-focal imaging is relatively insensitive to buried interfaces, electron ptychography reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer, emphasizing its crucial role in addressing interface roughness challenges in oxide twistronics.

**7. [Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320v1)**
-   **Authors**: Tim Titze, Sabri Koraltan, Timo Schmidt, Mailin Matthies, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Dieter Suess, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil
-   **Date**: 2025-10-24
-   **Objective**: Investigate how engineering stripe domains in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers can control the order and dynamics of bubble and skyrmion lattices.
-   **Finding**: Applying a brief in-plane "set" magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both the frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and magnetic force microscopy (MFM), complemented by micromagnetic simulations, revealed that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. This demonstrates that modifying the initial domain configuration enables precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics and potentially topology.

-   **Finding**: Boron nitride (BN) coatings were developed for CR-39 to enhance neutron detection efficiency by converting neutrons into energetic alpha particles through the $^\text{10}\text{B(n,}\alpha\text{)}^\text{7}\text{Li}$ reaction. Separate partially coated CR-39 pieces were exposed to AmBe, $^\text{252}\text{Cf}$, and D-T (14 MeV) neutron sources, and subsequently analyzed under an optical microscope and through large-area Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging over the irradiated area. The detection efficiency (tracks per neutron) was evaluated for each source spectra, confirming the enhancement provided by the BN coating.

-   **Date**: 2025-10-23
-   **Objective**: Systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) analysis for sub-10 nm probes, using the first-order magnetostructural transition in FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference.
-   **Finding**: Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enabled element-specific measurement of spin and orbital magnetic moments in FeRh across its metamagnetic phase transition. The extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remained consistent with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$ was observed, attributed to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity. This confirms EMCD's quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments.

**11. [Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517v2)**
-   **Authors**: M. J. Adriaans, J. P. Hoogenboom, A. Mohammadi-Gheidari
-   **Date**: 2025-10-23
-   **Objective**: Propose a cost-effective and simple electrostatic electron monochromator design based on pure fringe fields, addressing the limitations of current monochromators in scanning electron microscopes.
-   **Finding**: Current monochromators exhibit extreme sensitivity to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections, necessitating additional correcting elements. This study demonstrates that a fringe-field deflector is less sensitive to these issues. A cost-effective and simple monochromator design approach based on pure fringe fields is proposed, which achieves optimal energy resolution by including momentary deceleration lenses surrounding the main deflector without extra correcting elements. This fully electrostatic design could be realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies in electron microscopy.

This large dataset was then used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling statistical reconstruction of 3D microstructures from 2D SEM images. An error analysis on key geometrical descriptors quantitatively evaluated the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool.

At low Ta content, basal twin boundaries and planar faults containing C14 $\text{TaFe}_2$ Laves phase layers were observed, transitioning to pyramidal $\{1\bar{1}02\}$ twins at higher Ta content. Density functional theory calculations confirmed a chemical potential-driven stabilization of Laves phase lamellae, providing fundamental insights into defect engineering and optimizing material properties through chemical tuning in structurally complex intermetallics.

-   **Finding**: Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique, is capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures by detecting local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline samples through precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion. The study mapped lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe, achieving a parameter precision of $\sim$0.01% and a temperature sensitivity of $2.2\ \text{K}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern and can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes.

-   **Finding**: A scalable process using patterned thin-film stressors deterministically induces strain in 2D materials, enabling the construction of heterostrain-induced moiré superlattices. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to directly resolve the induced heterostrain, lattice deformations, and stacking variations that produce the moiré superlattice. The study found that uniaxial and biaxial heterostrain give rise to distinct moiré patterns, including stripes and distorted hexagonal patterns, and successfully created in-plane polar distortions and polarization at the domain boundaries of the moiré superlattice in $\text{MoS}_2$.

-   **Finding**: Ion-beam irradiation of $\text{MoO}_3$-Ag-Au multilayer plasmonic substrates with 100 MeV $\text{Ag}^{8+}$ swift heavy ions caused dewetting of metal films, prompting structural and morphological changes that resulted in the formation of dispersed Ag-Au nanoparticles, enhanced surface roughness, and defect generation within the $\text{MoO}_3$ lattice. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) elucidated nanoparticle formation and surface reorganization. These structural changes, corroborated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealing oxygen vacancies ($\text{V}_\text{O}$) and partial reduction of Mo, significantly increased Raman intensities in SERS measurements, demonstrating enhanced plasmonic hotspot density.
