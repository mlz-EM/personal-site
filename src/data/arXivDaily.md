- **Authors**: Joshua Renner, Matthew A. Wright, Kristofer Bouchard, Bruce E. Cohen, Peter Ercius, Azriel Goldschmidt, Cassio C. S. Pedroso, Ambarneil Saha, Peter Denes
- **Date**: 2025-11-06
- **Objective**: To develop and validate Back-Propagation Counting (BPC), a machine learning-based method for robust single-electron counting in direct electron detectors, particularly effective at high electron fluence.
- **Finding**: BPC is robust to increasing electron occupancy in synthetic data. In experimental data, frames counted with BPC produced images with improved contrast and reconstructed diffraction peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher intensity compared to standard methods. This demonstrates that BPC excels in electron microscopy experiments involving high electron flux, such as *in situ* TEM movies and diffraction.

- **Authors**: Henry C. Hammer, Caleb Whittier, Nathan A. Helvy, Christopher Rouleau, Nabil D. Bassim, Ravitej Uppu
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the controlled, low-temperature pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of epitaxial Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates for hybrid quantum photonic integration.
- **Finding**: Controlled surface preparation enabled the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{\circ}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness. **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** confirmed that high-temperature growth or improper surface preparation resulted in rough, polycrystalline rutile film, while the optimized low-temperature process preserved the anatase phase and interface quality. This establishes a materials platform suitable for integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources.

**35. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part II - COMSOL Simulation and Apparatus Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03821v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley

Microstructural and DFT analysis demonstrated that these defects form localized layers of a distinct phase (EuSnAs$_{2}$) where the reduced distance between Eu layers promotes local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering. This finding, enabled by HRTEM, explains the puzzling low-field magnetic features observed in the bulk antiferromagnetic material.

This information was used to deterministically map the local twist angle, revealing that deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain features. KPFM thus provides a crucial tool for nanoscale structural and electronic characterization in moiré systems.
