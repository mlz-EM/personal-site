**1. [Probing Plasmonic Oscillations in 2D Moiré Nanocrystal Superlattices by Low-Loss EELS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10534v1)**
- **Authors**: Swarnendu Das, Shengsong Yang, Kevin N. Moser, Marc R. Bourgeois, Quentin M. Ramasse, David J. Masiello, Christopher B. Murray, Eric A. Stach
- **Date**: 2026-02-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the plasmonic excitations and electronic properties of 2D moiré Au nanocrystal superlattices (NCSLs) formed by twisted hexagonal layers.
