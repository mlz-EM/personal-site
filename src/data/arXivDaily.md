**43. [Spectrometer-Free Electron Spectromicroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16894v1)**
- **Authors**: F. Javier García de Abajo, Cruz I. Velasco
- **Date**: 2025-04-23

This technique, while electron-based, relies on electron-light interaction and interference principles rather than traditional electron energy loss spectroscopy or filtering for spectral analysis.
