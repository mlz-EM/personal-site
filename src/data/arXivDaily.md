**1. [Questionable van der Waals Epitaxy of Non-Layered Materials on Fluorophlogopite Mica: The Case of ScN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05741v1)**
- **Authors**: Susmita Chowdhury, Faezeh Alijan Farzad Lahiji, Mikael Ottoson, Olivier Donzel-Gargand, Robert J. W. Frost, Martin Magnuson, Ganpati Ramanath, Arnaud le Febvrier, Per Eklund
- **Date**: 2026-02-05
- **Objective**: To experimentally verify the growth mechanism (vdW epitaxy vs. conventional epitaxy) of non-layered ScN on fluorophlogopite mica.
- **Finding**: The growth of single-domain $\text{ScN}(111)$ on mica(001) occurs via conventional epitaxy, not van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE). X-ray diffraction and **electron microscopy** established the epitaxial relationship as $[-\overline{1}01](111)_{\text{ScN}}||[010](001)_{\text{mica}}$. The strong dependence of the (111) interplanar spacings on film thickness indicated compressive stress buildup, which explicitly refutes the stress-free growth characteristic of vdWE.

**2. [Ferroelectricity in Atomically Thin Metallic TaNiTe$_5$ with Ultrahigh Carrier Density](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05398v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhihua Liu, Shichong Song, Xunqing Yin, Chenhang Xu, Feng Liu, Guohua Wang, Peng Chen, Shengwei Jiang, Chunqiang Xu, Xiaofeng Xu, Weidong Luo, Dong Qian
- **Date**: 2026-02-05

- **Finding**: Irradiation-induced morphological changes, examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showed that continuous $\text{Ar}$ irradiation caused pronounced surface restructuring (corrugated and porous-like surfaces), strongly affecting the electrical resistance, particularly in the $\text{Au}+\text{C}_{60}$ system. In contrast, pulsed $\text{C}$ irradiation maintained compact, homogeneous surface morphologies and resulted in only minor changes in resistivity.

- **Objective**: To validate and characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants (highlands and south pole) to assess their physicochemical properties relevant for *in situ* oxygen production.
- **Finding**: The simulants demonstrated strong mineralogical and compositional fidelity to lunar samples. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ($\text{SEM-EDS}$) confirmed the composition. Favorable reduction behavior arose not only from ilmenite but also from distributed $\text{Fe}$-bearing silicate and glassy phases, indicating that oxygen extraction is governed by the whole-regolith response, supporting whole-regolith processing strategies.

- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that epitaxial strain can induce and control a robust ferroelectric state above room temperature in bulk cubic $\text{KTaO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial strain ($\sim -2.1\%$) stabilized a tetragonal polar phase in $\text{KTaO}_3$ with a transition temperature of $475 \text{ K}$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed the cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns relative to the tantalum columns at room temperature, providing direct evidence of the emergent polar ground state confirmed by optical and electrical measurements.

- **Authors**: Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Wei Lv, Xianfeng Wu, Guangdi Zhou, Zihao Nie, Yueying Li, Cui Ding, Danfeng Li, Hongtao Yuan, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To achieve continuous control over the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in infinite-layer nickelates using an $\text{operando}$ monitored reduction (OMR) method to modulate the $\text{Ni}$ $3d$ orbital electron occupancy.
- **Finding**: OMR enabled ultrawide-range continuous modulation of $\text{Ni}$ $3d$ occupancy from $\sim 3d^7$ to $\sim 3d^9$. The $3d$ occupancy was calibrated using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms combined with XAS. Angle-dependent magnetotransport suggests a mixture of 2D and 3D superconducting characters within the transition regime, indicating a deviation from the canonical 2D SIT model.

- **Authors**: Miran Joo, Huixin Xiu, Sabrina Baha, Ridha Zerdoumi, Ningyan Cheng, Christoph Somsen, Yujiao Li, Aleksander Kostka, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Alfred Ludwig, Christina Scheu
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To correlate the $\text{Ru}$ content, microstructural features, and defect formation with the electrocatalytic activity (specifically the hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) in $\text{Au-Pd-Pt-Ru}$ compositionally complex solid solution (CCSS) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing $\text{Ru}$ content caused lattice contraction and a transition in defect structure from high-density nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults. Electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) provided compositional data, while atom probe tomography (APT) revealed local compositional fluctuations at grain boundaries. HER activity improved significantly with higher $\text{Ru}$ content, demonstrating the link between defect engineering and catalytic performance.

- **Authors**: Bowen Zou, Yixu Wang, Xiao Shen, Philipp Krooss, Thomas Niendorf, Richard Dronskowski, Wenwen Song
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To reveal the elemental redistribution mechanisms during the co-precipitation of nanosized $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ phases in an $\text{Al}$-alloyed lightweight steel.
- **Finding**: Correlative transmission Kikuchi diffraction transmission electron microscopy ($\text{TKD-TEM}$) and atom probe tomography (APT) identified two co-nanoprecipitation modes. APT showed that the $\text{B}2$ phase evolves from a $\text{NiAl}$-type (isolated) to an $\text{FeAl}$-type (next to $\kappa$). Density functional theory (DFT) confirmed that $\text{Fe-Ni}$ atomic exchange between $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ is thermodynamically favorable at $800^\circ \text{C}$, stabilizing both phases during co-precipitation.

- **Finding**: Electrical transport measurements were successfully performed on $\text{NbN}$ devices inside the TEM using a continuous-flow cryo-holder, achieving an estimated base sample temperature of $8-9 \text{ K}$. Optimization of the thermal radiation shield was critical. It was observed that both electron beam imaging and the magnetic field of the objective lens perturb the superconducting state, highlighting the need for careful experimental control in correlative low-temperature TEM studies.

- **Authors**: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To investigate the presence of ferroelectric behavior and structural defects, specifically twin boundaries, in the photoactive halide perovskite $\text{CsPbI}_3$.
- **Finding**: Low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) directly revealed the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries ($\{110\}$ and $\{112\}$) in $\text{CsPbI}_3$ thin films. Remarkably, STEM observations showed that $\text{Pb}$ atoms shift at the $\{110\}$ boundaries, inducing a local ferroelectric-like polarization, thereby uncovering previously hidden ferroic functionality within this nominally centrosymmetric material.

- **Date**: 2026-01-17
- **Objective**: To study the electric charge transport mechanisms and colossal dielectric permittivity in $\text{BaTiO}_3$ ceramics synthesized by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) with varying carbon impurity content.
- **Finding**: The ceramics exhibited colossal relative dielectric permittivity ($10^5 - 10^6$ order). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to estimate the concentration and distribution of carbon impurity. Conduction was found to obey the Mott variable range hopping law. Increased carbon concentration led to decreased permittivity and resistivity in the hopping conduction range, consistent with the Heywang model.

**44. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ bilayers as a function of $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$), focusing on the effects of the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ decreased below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This structural change drove a crossover in the anomalous Hall effect ($\text{AHE}$) mechanism: from mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution in thick films to skew-scattering dominant mechanism ($n = 0.62$) in the high-resistive percolative films.

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To provide definitive evidence regarding the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ thin films, a candidate altermagnet, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
