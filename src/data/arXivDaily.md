- **Authors**: Qing Cheng, Sergey V. Erohin, Konstantin V. Larionov, Bin Gan, Pavel B. Sorokin, Xiandong Xu
- **Date**: 2025-08-09
- **Objective**: To identify the key mechanism responsible for the intrinsic brittleness of single crystal iridium, a long-standing puzzle.

- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on the structural and electronic properties, and ultimately superconductivity, in bilayer nickelates like La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.

It also identifies contrast transfer from inelastic/plural scattering (quadratic terms) and demonstrates a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) for incoherent scattering, promising depth sectioning of strong scatterers, thus generalizing phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and providing insights into full-field iterative ptychography.

- **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps.
- **Finding**: X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses revealed that pressing SCNCs distorts the fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Crucially, in-situ STEM analyses directly observed the migration and healing of stacking faults and structural changes at inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries during heat treatment. These observations, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, provide new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles and their remarkable mechanical properties.
