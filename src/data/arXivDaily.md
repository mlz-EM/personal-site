**32. [Atomic Topology and Magnetic Microstructure of Highly Mobile Type I and Supermobile Type II Twin Boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga Single Crystal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14096v1)**
- **Authors**: Ladislav Straka, Marek Vronka, Jan Maňák, Petr Veřtát, Hanuš Seiner, Oleg Heczko
- **Date**: 2025-05-20
- **Objective**: To investigate the atomic topology and magnetic microstructure of individual, highly mobile Type I and Type II twin boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga martensite single crystals.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was extensively used to characterize the twin boundaries. High-resolution TEM confirmed atomically sharp Type I twin boundaries along the (101) plane and revealed that Type II boundaries are also atomically sharp, contrary to previous suggestions of their diffuse nature, apart from occasional single-atomic-plane steps. Lorentz TEM showed 180° domain walls within martensite variants and demonstrated that magnetic induction reorients sharply across both twin boundaries, forming 90°-like magnetic domain walls that follow the c-axis easy-magnetization direction.

- **Authors**: Yifan Wang, Mai Tan, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Peter A. Crozier
- **Date**: 2025-05-20
- **Objective**: To develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of a CNN-based deep denoiser, the unsupervised deep video denoiser (UDVD), for revealing information from weak signals in Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) datasets acquired with direct electron detectors.
- **Finding**: The UDVD denoiser, specifically adapted for EELS datasets, was shown to effectively suppress noise and reveal hidden information in challenging real-data examples. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with EELS was the core technique, and the denoiser significantly improved the ability to map Gd dopants in $CeO_2$ nanoparticles and characterize vibrational modes in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with atomic resolution, even under low signal-to-noise conditions, by mitigating artifacts associated with direct electron detector pixel interfaces.

**34. [Unifying Strain-driven and Pressure-driven Superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: Suppressed charge/spin density waves and enhanced interlayer coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12733v1)**
- **Authors**: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: To elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ using density functional theory calculations, by analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics.
- **Finding**: The study found that compressive strain suppresses both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities, analogous to pressure effects, which is crucial for superconductivity. These findings are consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations, which confirmed an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at -0.9% strain, preceding superconductivity onset, thus providing experimental validation for the theoretical predictions regarding strain-induced structural changes.

- **Authors**: Bo Hao, Maosen Wang, Wenjie Sun, Yang Yang, Zhangwen Mao, Shengjun Yan, Haoying Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Lu Han, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dianxiang Ji, Yuefeng Nie
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: To investigate superconductivity and establish the phase diagram in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, exploring heterovalent doping as a tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity was observed across a wide doping range, with optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieving a $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar NiO$_2$ sites, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples, due to Coulomb repulsion under compressive strain. STEM also showed elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, suggesting a weakening of interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, which contributes to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films and provides critical atomic-scale insights into the unique phase diagram topology.

Comprehensive structural analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the epitaxial growth of GaN beneath the $h$-BN mask and the reduction of defects. These electron microscopy techniques were essential in verifying the self-adjusting nature of the disordered $h$-BN mask and the high quality of the selectively grown GaN.

- **Date**: 2025-05-16
- **Objective**: To reveal and characterize the presence of a previously unreported polar phase of WO$_3$ stabilized in thin films grown on YAlO$_3$ substrates by epitaxial strain.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial strain stabilized a triclinic polar phase in WO$_3$ thin films, whose unit cell was fully determined by large-scale reciprocal space mapping. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations revealed strain gradients around domain walls and local variations of octahedral tilts, which could explain the stabilization of the triclinic phase up to unexpectedly large film thicknesses. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) further evidenced the polar nature and local conductivity modulations, highlighting the potential for controlling conductivity and epitaxial strain in WO$_3$-based devices.

Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the feasibility of synthesizing Sr$_x$TiS$_3$ with varied modulation periodicities, providing direct experimental evidence for the structural modulations that are crucial for tuning the optical properties and achieving the theoretically predicted maximum birefringence.

- **Authors**: Moha Naeimi, Katharina Engster, Waqas Pervez, Ingo Barke, Sylvia Speller
- **Date**: 2025-05-14
- **Objective**: To conduct a comprehensive photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopic study of rubrene thin crystals, focusing on their crystalline morphologies and defect states.
- **Finding**: PEEM images, particularly using a 2-photon photoemission process (2PPE), revealed dominant electron emission localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states, while 1PPE showed uniform emission. This highlights a fundamental difference in photoemission mechanisms and provides a new framework for assessing the quality and internal structure of organic semiconductor thin films via wavelength-dependent photoemission imaging. Although not traditional electron microscopy for structural analysis (like TEM/SEM), PEEM is an electron-based imaging technique that directly visualizes electronic properties and defects at surfaces, which is critical for organic semiconductor performance.
