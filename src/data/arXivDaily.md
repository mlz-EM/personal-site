**1. [Noise2Void for Denoising Atomic Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07699v1)**
- **Authors**: William Thornley, Sam Sullivan-Allsop, Rongsheng Cai, Nick Clark, Roman Gorbachev, Sarah J. Haigh
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and quantify the effectiveness of the Noise2Void technique for denoising atomic-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images and videos.
- **Finding**: The Noise2Void technique successfully denoised atomic-resolution STEM data of gold adatoms on graphene, resulting in qualitatively improved visibility of both the adatoms and the graphene lattice. Quantification showed that this approach significantly outperformed traditional methods like total variation and simple Gaussian blurring, while also being compatible with high-speed real-time data acquisition rates (at least $45$ frames per second) without requiring manual intervention or prior sample knowledge.

**2. [Physics-embedded neural computational electron microscopy for quantitative 4D nanometrology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07311v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao-Jin Wang, Liqun Shen, Xin-Ning Tian, Lei Lei, Kexin Wang, Grigore Moldovan, Marc-Georg Willinger, Zhu-Jun Wang
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To present a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that achieves metrological three-dimensional reconstruction by deeply coupling a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning.
- **Finding**: By integrating a Vision Field Transformer as a high-speed, differentiable surrogate for physical simulations, the framework enables single-shot, quantitative 3D nanometrology with precision comparable to atomic force microscopy but at orders of magnitude higher throughput. Furthermore, this computational electron microscopy approach facilitates four-dimensional (3D real space plus time) *in situ* characterization, tracking dynamic surface evolution during copper redox and revealing previously invisible crystallographic kinetics.

**3. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties in ultrathin $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as the Fe layer thickness ($t_{Fe}$) is varied, focusing on the effects near the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction revealed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{Fe}$ decreased below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This structural change coincided with a divergence in transport measurements, and the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) scaling showed a crossover from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump mechanism (for $t_{Fe} > 30 \text{ \AA}$) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism (for $t_{Fe} \le 30 \text{ \AA}$), underscoring the strong interlink between microstructure and Hall transport.

**4. [Absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 revealed by X-ray linear dichroism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06791v1)**
- **Authors**: Siyu Wang, Chao Wang, Yanan Yuan, Jiangxiao Li, Fangfang Pei, Daxiang Liu, Chunyu Qin, Jiefeng Cao, Yamei Wang, Tianye Wang, Jiayu Liu, Jieun Lee, Guanhua Zhang, Christoph Klewe, Chenchao Yu, Fan Zhang, Dongsheng Song, Kai Chen, Weisheng Zhao, Dawei Shen, Ziqiang Qiu, Mengmeng Yang, Bin Hong, Qian Li
- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To provide clear evidence for the absence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ films, a candidate altermagnet, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD) combined with photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM).
- **Finding**: The XLD signal observed was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field direction, which contrasts sharply with predictions for magnetic order-related XLD. This strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for $\text{RuO}_2$. Distinct XLD signals observed at the $\text{Ru } M_3$ and $\text{O } K$ edges on different substrates were attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field, confirming XLD as a robust technique for probing such materials.

Benedek, Andrej Singer, David A. Muller, Darrell G. Schlom
- **Date**: 2026-01-10
- **Objective**: To achieve the epitaxial stabilization of metastable tantalum dioxide ($\text{TaO}_2$) thin films on $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ substrates using suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and thermal laser epitaxy (TLE).
- **Finding**: Single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained $\text{TaO}_2$ thin films was achieved. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provided microstructural investigation, while electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the tetravalent oxidation state of tantalum. Optical measurements revealed a $0.3 \text{ eV}$ Mott gap, suggesting the potential for a hidden metal-insulator transition concomitant with a structural phase transition, similar to $\text{NbO}_2$.

- **Authors**: Alessia Fischetti, Giacometta Mineo, Daniela Russo, Francesco Salutari, Claudio Lentini Campallegio, Elena Bruno, Jordi Arbiol, Giorgia Franzò, Salvatore Mirabella, Vincenzina Strano, M. Chiara Spadaro
- **Date**: 2026-01-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the morphology, structure, and electrochemical energy storage mechanism of hydrothermally grown $\text{ZnO}/\text{ZnS}$ nanostructures decorating Ni foam.
- **Finding**: Electron microscopy-based methodologies confirmed the morphology, structure, and composition of the nanostructures. When Ni foam (NF) was used as the substrate, the system exhibited a predominant pseudocapacitive behavior, significantly outperforming the performance on graphene paper (GP). Mott-Schottky measurements suggested that the $\text{ZnS}$ decoration plays a key role as a hole reservoir, which boosts the electrochemical performance of the NF substrate.

**7. [On the Feasibility of Extreme Heating Rates in SEM using MEMS Heater Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05831v1)**
- **Authors**: C. Koenig, P. Mayr, J. R. Jinschek, A. Bastos Fanta
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the feasibility of using micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) heating platforms for *in-situ* Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) characterization of bulk-like samples during rapid thermal cycling.
- **Finding**: Stable heating and cooling rates up to $1000 \text{ C/s}$ were achieved under vacuum with minimal power input. Using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) *in situ*, the ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation in pure iron was successfully tracked, confirming the robustness of MEMS-based heating for quantitative microstructural studies of additive manufacturing-relevant thermal processes without compromising EBSD pattern quality.

- **Authors**: Callum Brennan-Rich, Sean M. Collins, Stuart Micklethwaite, Zabeada Aslam, Trevor Almeida, Stephen McVitie, Rik M. Drummond-Brydson, Christopher H. Marrows
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To produce and characterize high-quality epitaxial thin films of $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$ and $\text{FeSn}$ kagome alloys, including mixed-phase intergrowths, and correlate their structural and magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: High-quality epitaxial thin films of ferromagnetic $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$, antiferromagnetic $\text{FeSn}$, and mixed-phase intergrowths were synthesized. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods were used to characterize the crystallographic phase content, which showed correspondence with magnetization measurements. A unique behavior in the temperature-dependent coercivity was discovered in the highly mixed-phase alloys, suggesting novel magnetic coupling effects due to the intergrowths.

- **Authors**: Timon Sieweke, Chris Luther, Martin Wortmann, Lauritz Schnatmann, Felicitas Werner, Olga Kuschel, Laila Bondzio, Inga Ennen, Judith Bünte, Karsten Rott, Oluwaseyi Oluwabi, Moritz Loewenich, Joachim Wollschläger, Andreas Hütten, Jan Frenzel, Gabi Schierning, Alexander Kunzmann
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To establish a micro-pulling-down ($\mu$PD) apparatus for the fabrication of NiTi single crystals and perform detailed material characterization necessary for studying phase transitions.
- **Finding**: The $\mu$PD method successfully produced NiTi single crystals with reduced oxygen contamination. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) provided morphological and compositional data, while electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirmed the single-crystal orientation, establishing the material quality required for detailed studies of the phase transition which is highly sensitive to alloying and dopants.

**10. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\alpha$-Mn precipitates in an ultrafine-grained $\text{Mg}-1.35 \text{wt.}\% \text{Mn}$ alloy during room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT).
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that while the volume fraction of nm-scale $\alpha$-Mn particles increased with applied strain, the mean particle size remained constant. This, combined with the size distribution analysis, suggested that precipitate growth was governed by interfacial control rather than diffusional control, indicating that the reaction rate was limited by the diffusivity of Mn.

**11. [Cross-hatch strain effects on SiGe quantum dots for qubit variability estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05553v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Fabián Peña, Mitchell I. Brickson, Fabrizio Rovaris, J. Houston Dycus, Anthony McDonald, Zachary T. Piontkowski, Joel Benjamin Ruzindana, Adelaide M. Bradicich, Don Bethke, Robin Scott, Thomas E. Beechem, Francesco Montalenti, N. Tobias Jacobson, Ezra Bussmann
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To quantify how residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity in $\text{SiGe}$ virtual substrates propagates into heterostructure overgrowth and influences the interface structure and potential qubit properties.
- **Finding**: Correlative measurements, including cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of the interface structure, revealed a strong interplay between strain and roughness. Modeling based on measured strains suggests that spurious double-dot qubit detunings of $0.1 \text{ meV}$ may arise over $100 \text{ nm}$ distances. The findings recommend thicker virtual substrate buffer layers and lower-temperature growth ($T \le 700 \text{ }^{\circ}\text{C}$) to mitigate interface roughening.

**12. [Layered CrGe1-xSe3+y with Cr Kagome Lattice and Antiferromagnetic Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05360v1)**
- **Authors**: Jeremy G. Philbrick, Chaoguo Wang, Xin Gui, Tai Kong
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a new layered material, $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$.
- **Finding**: Single crystal X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy determined that $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$ crystallizes in the space group $R\bar{3}m$, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms. Unlike the ferromagnetic behavior in $\text{CrGeTe}_3$, this compound displays antiferromagnetic order below $50 \text{ K}$, suggesting that the presence of this phase limits the possibility of a ferromagnetic $\text{CrGeSe}_3$ analogue.

**13. [Oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries in Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb thin films for superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05326v1)**
- **Authors**: Jaeyel Lee, Dieter Isheim, Zuhawn Sung, Francesco Crisa, Sabrina Garattoni, Mustafa Bal, Cameron J. Kopas, Josh Y. Mutus, Hilal Cansizoglu, Jayss Marshall, Kameshwar Yadavalli, Dominic P. Goronzy, Mark C. Hersam, David N. Seidman, Alex Romanenko, Anna Grassellino, Akshay A. Murthy
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analysis of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) in Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb thin films used for superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed oxygen segregation at GBs in both film types, with the enrichment factor ($C_{gb}/C_{grain}$) being $2.7$ for Nb films and slightly reduced to $2.3$ for Ta-capped Nb. Higher oxygen concentration in the Nb grains led to greater segregation levels. This segregation correlates with a suppression of the critical temperature ($T_c$), providing atomic-scale insight into a mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits.

**14. [Correlative Ultrafast Imaging of a Propagating Photo-Driven Phase Transition Using 4D STEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05018v1)**
- **Authors**: Arthur Niedermayr, Jianyu Wu, Bertina Fisher, Ido Kaminer, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To directly probe the spatiotemporal propagation and strain dynamics of a laser-excited insulator-metal phase transition in vanadium dioxide ($\text{VO}_2$) using ultrafast four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM).
- **Finding**: Ultrafast 4D STEM enabled virtual imaging and strain mapping at every point in space and time on picosecond timescales. This direct imaging capability revealed the dynamics of the structural phase transition and correlated atomic-scale symmetry breaking with the resulting strain formation, demonstrating how lattice distortions propagate to govern macroscopic property changes in correlated oxides under non-equilibrium conditions.

**15. [Discovery of a new weberite-type antiferroelectric: La3NbO7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04916v2)**
- **Authors**: Louis Alaerts, Jesse Schimpf, Xinyan Li, Jiongzhi Zheng, Ella Banyas, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Sinéad M. Griffin, Yimo Han, Lane W. Martin, Geoffroy Hautier
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To discover and characterize a new lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectric material, $\text{La}_3\text{NbO}_7$, guided by first-principles computational screening.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial $\text{La}_3\text{NbO}_7$ thin films were synthesized, displaying the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure. The material exhibits a high breakdown field ($\approx 6 \text{ MV/cm}$), opening opportunities for energy storage, and its antiferroelectricity is explained by a simpler Kittel-type mechanism involving niobium atom movement through a single phonon mode.

**16. [Ultrafast laser-driven topological phase patterning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03881v1)**
- **Authors**: Jianyu Wu, Arthur Niedermayr, Gaolong Cao, Oscar Grånäs, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To demonstrate microscopic and dynamic control over quantum states by using femtosecond laser excitation to pattern topological phases in the Weyl semimetal $\text{WTe}_2$.
- **Finding**: By engineering a transient optical grating, the material was spatially selectively and reversibly driven between the topological $T_d$ and trivial $1T^*$ phases. Ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM) directly visualized the formation of the periodic $T_d/1T^*$ heterostructure, observed the propagation of the phase front, and analyzed the nanoscale confinement of coherently excited optical phonon modes, establishing a platform for all-optical control of quantum states.

**17. [Structural heterogeneity-induced enhancement of transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion revealed by thermoelectric imaging in functionally graded materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03581v1)**
- **Authors**: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To investigate the transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion in functionally graded materials (FGMs) with graded structural heterogeneity using high-resolution thermoelectric imaging.
- **Finding**: Lock-in thermography (LIT) revealed a pronounced non-monotonic enhancement of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect in the atomic-heterogeneity regime, well before crystallization. Structural analyses using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) identified $\text{Fe}$-based crystalline alloys and $\text{Cu}$ nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix, demonstrating that this subtle structural heterogeneity is responsible for the enhanced transverse electron transport response.

**18. [Energy-Resolved Real-Space Imaging of Orbital Nematicity in an Fe-Based Superconductor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02707v1)**
- **Authors**: Asato Onishi, Zifan Xu, Cédric Bareille, Yoichi Kageyama, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Taniuchi, Takasada Shibauchi
- **Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Objective**: To visualize the energy dependence of orbital nematicity in real space within individual nematic domains of the $\text{Fe}$-based superconductor $\text{Ba}_{1-x}\text{Na}_x\text{Fe}_2\text{As}_2$ using energy-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM).
- **Finding**: Using $5.82 \text{ eV}$ laser-excited PEEM, the evolution of linear dichroic (LD) contrast was visualized. A sign reversal of the LD contrast was discovered at an energy $\sim 0.4 \text{ eV}$ below the Fermi level, which directly reveals an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain. This finding highlights a different energy-dependent redistribution of spectral weight between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ states, crucial for understanding orbital-selective coherence in the nematic phase.

**19. [Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01846v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop a full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction that incorporates the two-photon process, extending the understanding beyond the single-photon Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect.
- **Finding**: The theory reveals that the two-photon emission/absorption process can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of the optical near field, and quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes is possible. Furthermore, the theory analytically deduces that the Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect (elastic scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic scattering) are both forms of the two-photon process, unifying the understanding of these quantum phenomena.

- **Authors**: Miss Nourin Nurain Amina, Md Noushad Hossain, Muhammad Shahriar Bashar, Munira Sultana, Md. Salahuddin Mina
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To synthesize $\text{NiO}/\text{ZnO}$-based thin films using a non-vacuum sol-gel spin-coating method and investigate the effect of stacking order and Na doping on their electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications.
- **Finding**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterized the surface morphology. The $\text{NiO}/\text{ZnO}$ heterostructure demonstrated a synergistic effect, achieving a maximum specific capacitance of $1.627 \text{ Fg}^{-1}$ at $2.0 \text{ mA cm}^{-2}$, surpassing the performance of the single-layer $\text{NiO}$ film ($1.391 \text{ Fg}^{-1}$). Sodium doping also significantly enhanced the capacitance of $\text{ZnO}$, highlighting the potential of cost-effective oxide heterostructures for energy storage.

- **Authors**: Lauren J. Riddiford, Anne Flechsig, Shilei Ding, Emir Karadza, Niklas Kercher, Tobias Goldenberger, Elisabeth Müller, Pietro Gambardella, Laura J. Heyderman, Aleš Hrabec
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To generate unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) and achieve field-free magnetization switching by patterning continuous crystalline phase gradients in tungsten (W) thin films using direct-write laser annealing.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used alongside electrical measurements to track the continuous phase transformation from the high-SOT $\beta$-W phase to the low-SOT $\alpha$-W phase with increasing laser fluence. Wires interfaced with $\text{CoFeB}$ that possessed a sufficiently strong phase gradient could switch the magnetization without an external magnetic field, demonstrating that precise control over the local microstructure allows for spatial programming of SOT efficiency.

**22. [Calorimetric Measurement of the Surface Energy of Enstatite, MgSiO$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01314v1)**
- **Authors**: Megan A. Householder, Tamilarasan Subramani, Kristina Lilova, James R. Lyons, Rhonda M. Stroud, Alexandra Navrotsky
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To perform the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite ($\text{MgSiO}_3$) nanoparticles using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry.
- **Finding**: Electron microscopy confirmed that the synthesized materials consisted of crystallites ($\sim 10 - 20 \text{ nm}$) agglomerated into larger nanoparticles, necessitating the consideration of both surface and interface terms in the energetic analysis. The surface enthalpy of enstatite was determined to be $4.79 \pm 0.45 \text{ J m}^{-2}$, a large value that may present a barrier to nucleation in planetary environments, and the methodology successfully separated surface and interfacial contributions.

**23. [Fabrication of Dense Ultrafine-Grained MoW, MoWNb, and MoWNbTa Alloys: Influence of Cobalt Doping on Sintering and Grain Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00246v1)**
- **Authors**: Keyu Cao, Sashank Shivakumar, Jian Luo
- **Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Objective**: To fabricate dense ultrafine-grained (UFG) refractory $\text{MoW}$, $\text{MoWNb}$, and $\text{MoWNbTa}$ alloys and investigate the effect of $2 \text{ at.}\%$ cobalt (Co) doping on sintering and high-temperature grain growth resistance.
- **Finding**: Co doping enhanced relative densities (up to $98\%$) and significantly suppressed the relative grain growth rate at $1200 \text{ }^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $1300 \text{ }^{\circ}\text{C}$, particularly in compositionally complex alloys, supporting the high-entropy grain boundary (HEGB) effect. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed strong Co segregation at the grain boundaries, accompanied by minor depletion of Ta and W, which explains the enhanced grain growth resistance.

- **Authors**: Daewon Lee, Sam Oaks-Leaf, Hyeonjong Ma, Jianlong He, Zhiqi Wang, Yifeng Shi, Eonhyoung Ahn, Karen C. Bustillo, Chengyu Song, Stephanie M. Ribet, Rohan Dhall, Colin Ophus, Mark Asta, Jiwoong Yang, Younan Xia, David T. Limmer, Haimei Zheng
- **Date**: 2025-12-31
- **Objective**: To determine how the confined geometry of palladium nanocrystals influences the phase transformation pathways during hydrogenation to form palladium hydride ($\text{PdH}_x$).
- **Finding**: *In situ* liquid phase transmission electron microscopy provided direct visualization of hydrogenation in Pd nanocubes and hexagonal nanoplates. While both followed similar general sequences, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\text{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibited geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments: nanocubes showed $\{100\}$-aligned interfaces (consistent with static elastic energy), whereas nanoplates displayed $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces, demonstrating that geometry fundamentally directs the accessibility of alternative, far-from-equilibrium transformation pathways.

**25. [Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430v2)**
- **Authors**: Ashley Dickson, Niccolò Di Eugenio, Federico Ledda, Daniele Torsello, Francesco Laviano, Flyura Djurabekova, Jesper Byggmästar, Mark R. Gilbert, Duc Nguyen-Manh, Erik Gallo, Antonio Trotta, Davide Gambino, Samuel T. Murphy
- **Date**: 2025-12-30
- **Objective**: To use modern machine-learned interatomic potentials (ACE and tabGAP) to accurately model and predict radiation damage in oxygen-deficient $\text{YBa}_2\text{Cu}_3\text{O}_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) for fusion applications.
- **Finding**: Molecular dynamics simulations using the machine-learned potentials predicted enhanced peak defect production and recombination compared to empirical models. Crucially, $300 \text{ keV}$ cascade simulations relevant to fusion environments revealed amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, a result consistent with prior electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes, thus establishing these potentials as predictive tools for investigating radiation damage across relevant oxygen stoichiometries.

**26. [Non-Euclidean interfaces decode the continuous landscape of graphene-induced surface reconstructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24220v1)**
- **Authors**: Li-Qun Shen, Hao-Jin Wang, Mengzhao Sun, Yang Xiang, Xin-Ning Tian, Yue Chai, Yue Yang, Feng Ding, Xiao Kong, Marc-Georg Willinger, Zhu-Jun Wang
- **Date**: 2025-12-30
- **Objective**: To overcome the topological limitations of flat substrates by using non-Euclidean (curved) graphene-copper surfaces to decode the continuous crystallographic landscape governing surface reconstruction.
- **Finding**: Surface reconstruction is governed by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local minima in the surface energy landscape. Multimodal microscopy, including 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM), integrated with a deep-learning-enhanced dimensional upscaling framework, was crucial for translating 2D contrast into quantitative 3D morphologies and accurate facet identification.

**27. [Fluoride doping into SiO2-MgO-CaO bioactive glass nanoparticles: bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility assessments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06080v1)**
- **Authors**: N. Esmati, T. Khodaei, E. Salahinejad, E. Sharifi
- **Date**: 2025-12-30
- **Objective**: To study the structure, bioactivity, biodegradation, and biocompatibility of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$-$\mathrm{MgO}$-$\mathrm{CaO}$ bioactive glass nanoparticles doped with different levels of fluoride.
- **Finding**: There exists an optimum level of fluoride doping that maximizes both *in vitro* biomineralization (bioactivity) and biocompatibility with osteoblast-like $\mathrm{MG}$-$63$ human cells. Electron microscopy was utilized, alongside Raman spectroscopy and $\mathrm{ICP}$-$\mathrm{OES}$, to investigate the morphology and progression of biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples.

**28. [Exploring phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals using liquid-phase TEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23588v1)**
- **Authors**: Olga Kaczmarczyk, Konrad Cyprych, Dominika Benkowska-Biernacka, Rafał Kowalczyk, Katarzyna Matczyszyn, Hanglong Wu, Frances M. Ross, Andrzej Miniewicz, Andrzej Żak
- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **Objective**: To perform *in situ* observations of phase transitions and dynamic responses in nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs), using 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as a model system, via liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM).
- **Finding**: The electron beam induces consecutive phase changes ($\mathrm{SmA} \to \mathrm{N}$ and $\mathrm{N} \to \mathrm{I}$), where the transition time shortens with increasing dose rate, suggesting substantial heat generation drives the phenomena. LP-STEM enabled the observation of spontaneous disclination formation, ordering effects, and process reversibility, providing the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using this technique.

**29. [Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $SrVO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843v1)**
- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To establish a direct and controllable method for recovering the intrinsic metallic character of $\mathrm{SrVO}_{3}$ ($\mathrm{SVO}$) surfaces by thermally reducing the oxidized near-surface region ($\mathrm{NSR}$) under ultra-high vacuum.
- **Finding**: Thermal reduction causes a sharp transformation from a $\mathrm{V}^{5+}$-dominated surface to a $\mathrm{V}^{4+}$-dominated mixed valence state, recovering metallic behavior. Ex-situ high-resolution scanning electron microscopy ($\mathrm{HR}$-$\mathrm{SEM}$), combined with $\mathrm{XRD}$ and $\mathrm{AFM}$, suggested that this recovery involves mass redistribution and partial oxygen loss, leading to nanoscale surface reorganization rather than $\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ volatilization.

- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the influence of W concentration on short-range order ($\mathrm{SRO}$) and subsequent deformation behavior in $\mathrm{Ni}$-$\mathrm{xW}$ alloys.
- **Finding**: Strong $\mathrm{SRO}$ emerges when W content exceeds about $30~\mathrm{wt}\%$, promoting planar slip and twin formation during deformation, which significantly enhances strain-hardening capacity and flow stress. Transmission electron microscopy ($\mathrm{TEM}$) was used to characterize the microstructure and deformation mechanisms (planar slip/twinning), while atom probe tomography ($\mathrm{APT}$) provided atomic-level insight into the short-range ordering and grain boundary chemistry.

- **Authors**: E. Salahinejad, M. Jafari Baghjeghaz
- **Date**: 2025-12-24
- **Objective**: To synthesize novel $\mathrm{Ca}$-$\mathrm{Mg}$ oxyfluorosilicates with varying fluoride levels and evaluate the effects of fluoride incorporation on their structure, apatite-forming ability (biomineralization), and biodegradability.
- **Finding**: Samples with up to $2~\mathrm{mol}\%$ F formed a single-phase diopside ($\mathrm{MgCaSi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$). The optimal biomineralization characteristic was achieved at $1~\mathrm{mol}\%$ F, where fluoride partially incorporated into apatite (forming fluorohydroxyapatite) without forming fluorite ($\mathrm{CaF}_{2}$). Transmission electron microscopy ($\mathrm{TEM}$) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ($\mathrm{SEM}$/$\mathrm{EDS}$) were essential for evaluating the structural characteristics and the morphology and composition of the biomineralized deposits.

- **Finding**: $\mathrm{FF}$-$\mathrm{STEM}$ combines ptychographic phase reconstruction (from bright-field data for high resolution) with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging (for low-frequency contrast). The channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. This $4\mathrm{D}$-$\mathrm{STEM}$ approach enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction while retaining the advantages of ptychography.

**46. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of varying $\mathrm{Pt}$/$\mathrm{Ru}$ ratios on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of $\mathrm{NiCoCrAlYTa}$ coatings modified with $\mathrm{Pt}$-$\mathrm{Ru}$ overlays.
- **Finding**: Higher Pt content provided superior oxidation resistance by promoting the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous $\alpha$-$\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ layer (thermally-grown oxide, $\mathrm{TGO}$).
