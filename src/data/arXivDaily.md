-   **Authors**: Marco Moreira, Yves Fleming, Patrick Grysan, Christele Vergne, Adrian Marie Philippe, Petru Lunca-Popa
-   **Date**: 2025-06-16
-   **Objective**: To investigate how various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) influence the structure and properties of Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.
-   **Finding**: Dopant incorporation in Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films was found to be well below nominal concentrations, with only Al and Sc present above detection. **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** indicated that films grown on c-plane sapphire were epitaxial near the substrate interface but relaxed into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon were polycrystalline throughout. Despite limited dopant incorporation, subtle structural and optical shifts suggest that dopant precursor chemistry and growth conditions play a significant role in influencing film stoichiometry and properties.

**22. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
-   **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
-   **Date**: 2025-06-11
-   **Objective**: To explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and develop approaches to optimize $Z$ sensitivity.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that the $Z$-dependence of **electron ptychography** is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column considered. While a monotonic $Z$-dependence is found for small integration regions, increasing the area leads to a significantly non-monotonic $Z$-contrast following orbital shell-structure trends. This non-monotonic behavior was shown to be useful for accentuating contrast between certain elements, allowing for distinguishability of elements that are only a single atomic number apart (e.g., $\beta$-CuZn, $Z = 29$ and $30$) even in thick samples ($> 20$ nm), thereby providing a method to optimize ptychographic $Z$-contrast for specific applications.

A custom-developed machine learning workflow was applied to **atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** images to detect, classify, and average point vacancy defects. This enabled the uncovering of several distinct Cr interstitial defect complexes, combined Cr and Br vacancy defect complexes, and lines of vacancy defects that extend over many unit cells, whose occurrence aligns with computed structures and binding energy densities. This work broadens the scope of defect studies in challenging and beam-sensitive materials and reveals new defect types in bilayer CrSBr.

While the paper notes that **electron microscopy** requires vacuum conditions, restricting its in-situ applicability for nanoscale photothermal mapping, their developed system achieves a temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.1 K under ambient conditions without needing an additional temperature-sensitive layer. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigating localized thermal effects in fields such as semiconductors, nanophotonics, and photocatalysis.

-   **Objective**: To noninvasively elucidate dielectric losses, structural heterogeneity, and interface imperfections in encapsulated niobium transmon qubits using terahertz (THz) nano-imaging/-spectroscopy.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated noninvasive THz nano-imaging/-spectroscopy of encapsulated niobium transmon qubits, revealing sidewall near-field scattering that correlates with qubit coherence. While the primary diagnostic is THz nanophotonics, the paper highlights its advantage over "destructive electron microscopy" for characterizing qubit performance, implying that electron microscopy is a conventional method for structural diagnostics, but the new THz method offers a non-invasive, high-throughput alternative for correlating with qubit coherence.

-   **Authors**: Cheng-Yu Chen, Duncan Burns, Peter W. Voorhees, Eric A. Stach
-   **Date**: 2025-06-04
-   **Objective**: To investigate the dynamics and coalescence of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles on dynamically evolving, heterogeneous silicon nitride (SiN$_x$) substrates using in situ transmission electron microscopy.
-   **Finding**: In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that Pt nanoparticles in contact with localized crystalline silicon (Si) nanodomains on SiN$_x$ substrates transformed into a more mobile platinum silicide (Pt$_3$Si) phase. These Pt$_3$Si nanoparticles exhibited pronounced directional migration away from the Si pads, driven by interfacial energy gradients, rather than undergoing stochastic Brownian motion. This directed movement fundamentally dictates coalescence pathways, providing insights into how substrate heterogeneity can be used to direct nanoparticle behavior.

-   **Date**: 2025-06-03
-   **Objective**: To directly access local amplitude correlations of charge density wave (CDW) ordering in 2H-NbSe2 using cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM).
-   **Finding**: Cryogenic 4D-STEM measurements, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling down to 20 K, allowed mapping of the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution. By analyzing their autocorrelations, the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter was extracted, revealing that weak short-range amplitude correlations persist above the transition temperature and grow significantly upon cooling, reaching approximately 150 nm at 20 K. These findings demonstrate 4D-STEM as a powerful tool for probing spatially inhomogeneous electronic order in quantum materials.

-   **Date**: 2025-05-31
-   **Objective**: To address a one-dimensional phase problem linking energy and time in X-ray scattering from ultrasharp nuclear resonances by leveraging the M\"ossbauer effect and ptychographic phase retrieval.
-   **Finding**: This study focuses on X-ray scattering and phase retrieval, not directly electron microscopy. However, it leverages the concept of "ptychographic phase retrieval in imaging" to develop a robust approach for extracting spectral information from single measurements using multiple energetically overlapping measurements. This analogy highlights ptychography as a powerful phase retrieval technique applicable across various imaging modalities, including electron microscopy, for full reconstruction of object structures.

-   **Authors**: Samantha E. Smith, Santiago Bermudez, Pavan Chaitanya, Zoe Boekelheide, Jessika Rojas Marin, Ravi L. Hadimani
-   **Date**: 2025-05-30
-   **Objective**: To examine the impact of high-dose X-ray irradiation on the magnetic and structural properties of Gd$_5$Si$_4$ nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia treatment.
-   **Finding**: While X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed no structural or compositional changes in Gd$_5$Si$_4$ nanoparticles after high-dose X-ray irradiation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed localized lattice distortions. These TEM observations of lattice distortions were correlated with observable changes in magnetic properties, although magnetocaloric properties and specific loss power remained unaffected, supporting the stability of Gd$_5$Si$_4$ for potential radiotherapy and magnetocaloric cooling applications.

**35. [Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176v1)**
-   **Authors**: J. M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
-   **Date**: 2025-05-30
-   **Objective**: To study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si) formed by self-ion implantation, focusing on the evolution of Medium-Range Order (MRO) upon thermal annealing.
-   **Finding**: Using Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM), the study found that the degree of Medium-Range Order (MRO) in amorphous silicon first increases on thermal annealing, then decreases, and finally recrystallizes, a result not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. FEM was instrumental in observing this MRO. The findings suggest that a paracrystalline (PC) model is more favorable for a-Si, and that high-dose implantation leads to a high defect density in the PC phase which anneals out at 500$^\circ$C, resulting in a metastable and highly-ordered structure.

-   **Finding**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the nanoparticle morphology, demonstrating the ability to control nanoparticle size by a dewetting process combined with microwave-induced coalescence. Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction confirmed the stabilization of the $\alpha$-Sn phase within a SnO$_2$ shell, and infrared transmission spectroscopy estimated the bandgap in the 64 to 137 meV range. The study demonstrated the possibility to tune the bandgap by controlling nanoparticle size, leveraging weak quantum confinement effects, with the morphological insights from SEM and AFM being crucial.

-   **Authors**: Sharmistha Dey, Nahid Chaudhary, Ulrich Kentsch, Rajendra Singh, Pankaj Srivastava, Santanu Ghosh
-   **Date**: 2025-05-27
-   **Objective**: To investigate the alterations in magnetic properties and electronic structure of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown nano-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) after low energy ion irradiation, aiming to induce robust room temperature ferromagnetism.
-   **Finding**: Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images confirmed triangular-flake formation in pristine MoS$_2$ and showed that increasing irradiation fluences caused larger flakes to fragment into smaller ones, enhancing the number of edge-terminated structures. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the formation of S-vacancies after irradiation. The study concluded that the impact of edge-terminated structures and point defects like S-vacancies induces room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM), with saturation magnetization increasing with ion irradiation fluences.

-   **Finding**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for morphological and structural characterization of the F-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$ nanoparticles on Vulcan XC72 carbon. The enhanced H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration performance, particularly for Vulcan XC72 modified with 1.0% F-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$, was attributed to F doping. This doping increased Nb$_2$O$_5$ lattice distortion and disorder (structural insights supported by TEM), improving electron availability for ORR, along with increased oxygenated species and hydrophilicity, which facilitated O$_2$ adsorption, transport, and electron transfer.

-   **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Vanessa S. Antonin, Caio Machado Fernandes, Liying Liu, Mauro C. Santos
-   **Date**: 2025-05-22
-   **Objective**: To investigate the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$ as electrocatalysts for improved H$_2$O$_2$ production via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
-   **Finding**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the morphology and structure of the Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$ nanoparticles on Vulcan XC72 carbon. The study found that Nb$_2$O$_5$ doped with 0.5% Ce showed the highest electrocatalytic response, producing significantly more H$_2$O$_2$ than the un-doped counterpart. This enhanced performance was attributed to local distortions in the Nb$_2$O$_5$ crystal lattice induced by Ce doping (structural insights from TEM), combined with increased hydrophilicity and wetting properties, which facilitated electron transfer and O$_2$ transport, favoring the ORR.

-   **Authors**: Ladislav Straka, Marek Vronka, Jan Maňák, Petr Veřtát, Hanuš Seiner, Oleg Heczko
-   **Date**: 2025-05-20
-   **Objective**: To investigate the atomic topology and magnetic microstructure of individual, highly mobile Type I and Type II twin boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga martensite using transmission electron microscopy.
-   **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed an atomically sharp Type I twin boundary oriented along the rational (101) plane and revealed that the Type II boundary was also atomically sharp, apart from occasional single-atomic-plane steps, contrary to previous suggestions of its diffuse nature. Lorentz TEM (LTEM) showed 180$^\circ$ domain walls within martensite variants and demonstrated that magnetic induction reorients sharply on both twin boundaries, forming 90$^\circ$-like magnetic domain walls that follow the c-axis easy-magnetization direction. These TEM techniques were critical for resolving the atomic and magnetic structures at these boundaries.

-   **Authors**: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
-   **Date**: 2025-05-19
-   **Objective**: To elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ by analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics using density functional theory calculations.
-   **Finding**: Consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations, the study found an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. The theoretical findings, supported by STEM observations, indicate that suppressed charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities, along with enhanced interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling ($J_\perp$), are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The study also proposes candidate substrates for achieving greater compressive strain to potentially increase $T_c$.

-   **Authors**: Bo Hao, Maosen Wang, Wenjie Sun, Yang Yang, Zhangwen Mao, Shengjun Yan, Haoying Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Lu Han, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dianxiang Ji, Yuefeng Nie
-   **Date**: 2025-05-19
-   **Objective**: To explore the phase diagram of heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$-doping in La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films and investigate its impact on superconductivity.
-   **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar NiO$_2$ sites in Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples, due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. STEM also showed elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weakening the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_c$ in strained films. These microscopic insights from STEM were crucial for understanding the unique phase diagram topology and the observed superconducting properties.
