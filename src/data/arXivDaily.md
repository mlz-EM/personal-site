**1. [Unexpected Anisotropic Mn-Sb Anti-site Distribution and Van der Waals Epitaxy of MnSb2Te4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11353v1)
- **Authors**: Gustavo Chavez Ponce de Leon, Ahmad Dibajeh, Gert ten Brink, Majid Ahmadi, Bart Jan Kooi, George Palasantzas
- **Date**: 2026-01-16
- **Objective**: To investigate the distribution of Mn-Sb anti-site defects in $\mathrm{MnSb}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{4}$ and establish a method for thin film growth suitable for Si-based architectures.

**4. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties in $\mathrm{Si}/\mathrm{Fe}$ bilayers as the $\mathrm{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Fe}}$) is varied near the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed a percolation-driven microstructural transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ decreases below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This structural evolution correlates strongly with the divergence observed in magnetotransport measurements, revealing a crossover in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) mechanism from mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution ($n \sim 1.42$) in thick films to skew-scattering-dominant ($n = 0.62$) in high-resistive films near the percolation onset.

- **Finding**: XLD measurements, supported by photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and multiple scattering calculations, provided strong evidence for the absence of magnetic order in $\mathrm{RuO}_{2}$. The observed XLD signal was nearly invariant with temperature and cooling field, instead being attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field, demonstrating XLD as a robust technique for probing low-symmetry magnetic materials.

**11. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of precipitate size and volume fraction of $\alpha-\mathrm{Mn}$ particles in an ultrafine-grained $\mathrm{Mg-Mn}$ alloy during high-pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature.
- **Finding**: Although the volume fraction of nm-scale $\alpha-\mathrm{Mn}$ particles increased with applied strain, analysis using Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and precipitate size distribution determined that the mean particle size did not increase over the course of HPT. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was used to analyze the nanoscale precipitates, suggesting that precipitate growth was subject to interfacial rather than diffusional control.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To analyze the atomic-scale distribution and segregation of oxygen at grain boundaries (GBs) in $\mathrm{Nb}$ and $\mathrm{Ta}$-encapsulated $\mathrm{Nb}$ thin films used for superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Oxygen segregation was observed at GBs in both $\mathrm{Nb}$ and $\mathrm{Ta}/\mathrm{Nb}$ films, with the oxygen enrichment factor ($\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{gb}}/\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{grain}}$) being $2.7 \pm 0.3$ for $\mathrm{Nb}$ films. Atom-Probe Tomography (APT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) provided atomic-scale chemical and structural insights, confirming that higher oxygen concentration in the $\mathrm{Nb}$ grains leads to greater segregation, which correlates with the suppression of the critical temperature ($\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{c}}$).

- **Authors**: Lauren J. Riddiford, Anne Flechsig, Shilei Ding, Emir Karadza, Niklas Kercher, Tobias Goldenberger, Elisabeth Müller, Pietro Gambardella, Laura J. Heyderman, Aleš Hrabec
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To generate unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) by creating patterned phase gradients in tungsten (W) thin films using direct-write laser annealing.
- **Finding**: Laser annealing induced a continuous phase transformation from the high-resistivity $\beta$-W phase (high SOT) to the low-resistivity $\alpha$-W phase (low SOT). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was essential for tracking and confirming this continuous crystalline phase transformation. By interfacing these graded W wires with $\mathrm{CoFeB}$, a sufficiently strong gradient enabled field-free magnetization switching, demonstrating precise control over local SOT efficiency.

- **Finding**: Real-time XPS confirmed a sharp transformation from a $V^{5+}$-dominated surface to a $V^{4+}$-dominated metallic state upon heating. Ex-situ characterization, including *high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM)*, indicated that this recovery is accompanied by nanoscale surface reorganization and mass redistribution, supporting a structural recovery pathway over volatilization.

- **Authors**: Shaozun Liu, Zehao Li, Hantong Chen, Xingyuan San, Bi-Cheng Zhou, Dieter Isheim, Tiejun Wang, Hong Gao, Nie Zhao, Yu Liu, Yong Gan, Xiaobing Hu
- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate how W concentration influences short-range order (SRO), deformation mechanisms, and strengthening in Ni-xW alloys.
- **Finding**: Strong SRO emerges when W content exceeds about $30~\mathrm{wt\%}$, significantly enhancing strain-hardening capacity. During deformation, the presence of SRO promotes planar slip and twin formation, leading to an exceptionally high grain boundary strengthening coefficient ($k_y \approx 1100~\mathrm{MPa} \cdot \mathrm{\mu m^{1/2}}$). *Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)* was used to characterize the deformation microstructure, while *atom probe tomography (APT)* provided atomic-level evidence linking increased W content to the stabilization of $Ni_4W$-type local configurations, driving SRO.

**32. [Structure, biomineralization and biodegradation of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates synthesized by inorganic salt coprecipitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21369v1)**
- **Authors**: E. Salahinejad, M. Jafari Baghjeghaz
- **Date**: 2025-12-24
- **Objective**: To synthesize and evaluate the structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability, and biodegradability of novel Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates containing fluoride substitution.
- **Finding**: Samples with up to $2~\mathrm{mol\%}$ F formed a single-phase diopside structure. Optimal biomineralization was found at $1~\mathrm{mol\%}$ F, attributed to the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (forming fluorohydroxyapatite). *Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)* and *scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS)* were used to analyze the resultant structure and the morphology and composition of the deposited apatite layer.

- **Authors**: Wyatt A. Curtis, Constantin R. Krüger, Axel P. Tracol Gavard, Jakub Hruby, Marcel Drabbels, Ulrich J. Lorenz
- **Date**: 2025-12-23
- **Objective**: To describe the design and operation of a novel apparatus for physical vapor deposition (PVD) onto cryo-EM samples to enable microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM experiments.

This capability facilitates new time-resolved experiments and removes preferred particle orientation. The system demonstrated that the minimum thickness of $SiO_2$ sealing membranes required is just over two monolayers.

- **Authors**: Barnaby D. A. Levin, Kalani Moore, Nicolò M. Della Ventura, McLean P. Echlin, Tresa M. Pollock, Daniel S. Gianola
- **Date**: 2025-12-18
