**1. [Improvement of H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16871v1)**
- **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Vanessa S. Antonin, Caio Machado Fernandes, Liying Liu, Mauro C. Santos
- **Date**: 2025-05-22
- **Objective**: To improve H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration using a Vulcan XC72 carbon electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$.
