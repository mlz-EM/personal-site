**1. [Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942v1)**
-   **Authors**: Vaibhav Choudhary, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
-   **Date**: 2025-08-13
-   **Objective**: To improve feature localization in secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques by modeling the full distribution of SE counts as a mixture rather than a simple convolution.
-   **Finding**: The study shows that the full distribution of SE counts in techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and helium ion microscopy (HIM) is a mixture, not just a convolution of the beam profile, which enables resolution improvements. Through Monte Carlo simulations and application to three real HIM datasets, the proposed maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) derived from time-resolved measurements (TRM) achieved a 5-fold to 5.4-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) for edge localization compared to conventional methods, demonstrating enhanced resolution in secondary electron imaging.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-28
-   **Objective**: To show how different processing steps (pressing, emulsion-templated self-assembly, heat treatment) influence the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in nanocomposites.
-   **Finding**: Pressing leads to fcc superlattice distortion, while self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Heat treatment significantly affects planar defects, causing stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes. **In-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses, combined with X-ray techniques, were crucial for directly observing these defect behaviors and rearrangements at the supercrystalline scale (tens of nm).**

-   **Objective**: To experimentally observe and characterize the non-uniform dipole organization within irreducibly narrow polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, specifically the formation of atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls.
-   **Finding**: The study revealed that within single atomic plane polar layers of ZrO$_2$, dipoles form atomically thin, charged 180-degree domain walls (alternating head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations) that confine in-plane domains to sub-nm$^2$ footprints. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film in plan view orientation was the key technique that enabled the first experimental observation of these antipolar ferroic orderings and hierarchical self-organization at the atomic scale.**
