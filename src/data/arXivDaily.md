- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed but showed little correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions. Crucially, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in the ferrimagnet. This direct microstructural evidence suggests that the Hall anomalies originate from trivial mechanisms, such as the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity.

- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust, constraint-free phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) by combining untrained coordinate-based neural fields with a physics-consistent forward model.
- **Finding**: CDIP substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in fidelity and stability for both static and dynamic reconstructions. This framework is broadly applicable to coherent imaging modalities, including electron probes like ptychography and holography, offering a paradigm shift for atomic-resolution imaging of non-crystalline specimens and their dynamics without relying on object-specific constraints.

- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework integrating modeling, simulation, and experiment for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and simulations predicted strain-induced elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, leading to rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. Experimental validation using *in situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) on $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary control mechanism.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models with respect to imaging conditions in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).
- **Finding**: Neural network segmentation models demonstrated significant performance stability, but their performance smoothly and predictably worsened as imaging conditions shifted from the training distribution. The study developed a framework using the HRTEM contrast transfer function (CTF) to compare information content and quantify OOD domain shifts in synthetic data generated via multislice simulation, providing essential guidance for ML deployment in experimental HRTEM workflows.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the critical influence of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of ($\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x$)$_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnets.
- **Finding**: Calculations showed that while $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ has a positive $K_{\rm u}$ under strain-free conditions, $K_{\rm u}$ becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements provided the crucial experimental input by revealing a compressive strain of up to 25% near the grain boundaries of the fabricated $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys, highlighting the necessity of considering microstructural strain in magnetic material design.

- **Authors**: Giannis Thalassinos, Alan G. Salek, Daniel Stavrevski, Qiang Sun, Mitchell O. de Vries, Colin M. MacRae, Nicholas C. Wilson, Andrew G. Tomkins, Dougal G. McCulloch, Andrew D. Greentree
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence of photoluminescent color centers in lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond), suggesting its potential as a new quantum-grade crystalline platform.
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in meteoritic lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable emission (peak at $\sim 700$ nm) with a $14$ ns excited-state lifetime and no detectable blinking. Correlative electron microscopy was essential for confirming the lonsdaleite host lattice structure, and compositional analysis suggested $\text{N}$, $\text{Si}$, or $\text{Ni}$ as plausible defect constituents.

**37. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To investigate the spatial evolution and mechanism of helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress.
- **Finding**: The reorientation process exhibits striking similarity to plastic deformation in metals, where the critical stress depends on the angle of the propagation vector ($\mathbf{Q}$) relative to the stress direction. Using *in situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM), the study directly observed that magnetic defects mediate the reorientation via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes, advancing the understanding of strain-driven magnetism.

**38. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the emergence and control of Surface Spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) governed by the in-plane phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that $\phi_0$ controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of SS at 1D FCIs, and determines the reorientation angle of SS in 2D FCIs. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, validating the role of $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states.

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox of the synthesizability of metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: Density functional theory revealed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale by its low surface energy, drastically lowering the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, which captured the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase particles and their subsequent slow transformation, providing a rational strategy for synthesizing metastable materials.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) above 60 K in epitaxial ($\text{La},\text{Pr}$)$_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset was achieved at $\sim 63$ K by using the Gigantic-Oxidative Atomic-layer-by-layer Epitaxy (GAE) method in an extreme non-equilibrium regime. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), along with synchrotron X-ray diffraction, confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity of the films, which is crucial for stabilizing the inherently metastable, strained superconducting phase and linking the enhanced $T_c$ to strange-metal-like behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$).

- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) denoising pipeline for time-series High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images that performs well on low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.
- **Finding**: The proposed pipeline, integrating a blind-spot convolution neural network with pre/post-processing, significantly outperforms other denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, improving the visual clarity of atomic features in HRTEM images. Crucially, the model is drastically faster than $\text{U}$-$\text{Net}$-based models, achieving millisecond inference speeds suitable for real-time application in *in situ* HRTEM experiments where low electron dosage is required.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2$-$\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and delineate stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and intermediate vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: The study identified boundaries between closely related phases, showing that local bixbyite order persists up to $\sim 50\%$ $\text{Ce}$ in equilibrium ceramics. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction was a critical tool in the multi-length-scale characterization package, helping to quantify the crystal structure and confirming that kinetic energy quenching in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase even with a highly vacated oxygen sublattice ($\sim 16.7\%$).

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the $\text{Co}$ $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ through interfacial engineering with various perovskite oxide layers ($\text{LaTiO}_3$, $\text{LaMnO}_3$, $\text{LaAlO}_3$, $\text{LaNiO}_3$).
- **Finding**: Interfacial charge transfer successfully tuned the $\text{Co}$ orbital occupancy from partial $d^7$ (with $\text{LaTiO}_3$) to partial $d^5$ (with $\text{LaNiO}_3$), and resulted in a $\text{Co}$ $d^6$ low spin state when using a $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed a clear connection between the strain induced by the interface and the resulting $\text{Co}$ spin configuration, emphasizing the importance of structural control in correlated oxides.

- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize a new class of hexagonal $\text{GeSn}$ solid solutions using high pressure and high temperature, overcoming the ambient limitations of the $\text{GeSn}$ system.
- **Finding**: Subjecting $\text{Ge}$ and $\text{Sn}$ to pressures up to 10 GPa resulted in the ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H $\text{GeSn}$ solid solutions ($\text{P6}_3/\text{mmc}$). Precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy were crucial for confirming the hexagonal symmetry and correlating its formation to $\text{Sn}$ uptake (accessible below 21 atom % $\text{Sn}$).

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To establish quantitative correlations between microstructural evolution and mechanical performance, particularly impact toughness, in $\text{PBF}$-$\text{LB}$-produced 17-4 $\text{PH}$ stainless steel subjected to aging heat treatments.
- **Finding**: $\text{PBF}$-$\text{LB}$ specimens showed high tensile strength but significantly lower impact toughness than conventionally manufactured counterparts. Multiscale microstructural characterization, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), identified $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions as detrimental nucleation sites for micro-cavities and characterized the tailored distribution of $\text{Cu}$-rich nanoprecipitates, revealing the pronounced strength-toughness trade-off.

**46. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations showed that instrumental variations significantly impact measurement accuracy. For a $21$ mrad probe, defocus can underestimate the electrostatic field magnitude by up to $16\%$. Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations exceeding $40\%$ for small field magnitudes. The analysis confirms the sensitivity of the scattergram-based method and underscores the critical need for optimized instrumental alignment in DPC-STEM for accurate electrostatic mapping.

- **Objective**: To report the *in situ* synthesis of iron oxide particles inside silicon nitride nanopores via a chemical reaction and demonstrate the reversible sealing and recovery of the nanopores.
- **Finding**: Nanopores fabricated by various methods (electroporation, TEM drilling, $\text{HF}$ etching) sealed reversibly on timescales from $\sim 1$ ms to $\sim 3.6$ s, independent of the fabrication method. Aberration-corrected scanning TEM (AC-STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) were used to verify the synthesis of mixed magnetite and maghemite iron oxide particles within the nanopores, advancing nanoparticle-nanopore chips for biosensing and photonics applications.

Comprehensive characterization, including electron microscopy, confirmed the high quality of the graphene layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of the $\text{graphene}/\text{SrTiO}_3$ heterostructure further revealed cooperative phenomena, such as substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the role of a $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer in homogenizing the growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite films on textured silicon bottom cells to improve tandem solar cell efficiency.
- **Finding**: The $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer prevents the formation of interfacial $\text{PbI}_2$ by fostering organic precursor incorporation, especially in areas with thin hole-transporting material coverage, leading to larger apparent perovskite grains and improved film quality. This microstructural improvement resulted in a high-efficiency perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell (30.3% certified), highlighting the importance of interface engineering for robust, scalable perovskite growth.
