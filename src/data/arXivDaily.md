- **Finding**: LTEM studies using the Fresnel mode revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon in ultrasmall skyrmions. Systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations attributed these chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation of the contrast transfer function, establishing quantitative limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for nanoscale magnetic imaging.

**37. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies in a Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet, determining if they arise from chiral spin textures or trivial mechanisms.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they lacked correlation with magnetic transitions, suggesting a non-topological origin. Most importantly, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures, leading to the conclusion that the anomalies are due to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity.

- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) that eliminates the need for handcrafted, object-specific constraints.
- **Finding**: CDIP, which combines untrained coordinate-based neural fields with a physics-consistent forward model, substantially outperformed classical iterative algorithms in fidelity and stability on simulated and experimental datasets. This framework provides a broadly applicable paradigm shift for coherent imaging modalities, including ptychography and holography, across X-ray, electron, and optical probes.

**39. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings using analytical modeling, simulations, and experimental observation.
- **Finding**: Analytical models predicted strain-induced elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, which was corroborated by simulations showing strain drives the collapse of the skyrmion lattice. *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) experiments on $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary control mechanism.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of neural network segmentation models with respect to imaging conditions in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).
- **Finding**: Using synthetic data generated via multislice simulation, it was demonstrated that neural network performance smoothly and predictably worsens as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. A framework utilizing the HRTEM contrast transfer function was developed to compare information content and quantify OOD domain shifts, which is essential for successful ML deployment in experimental EM workflows.

**41. [Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07285v1)**
- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys.
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) revealed a compressive strain of up to 25% near grain boundaries in $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys. DFT calculations showed that this strain critically influences magnetic properties: while $K_{\rm u}$ is positive under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain, highlighting the detrimental effect of lattice distortions on anisotropy.

- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence for optically active point defects (color centers) hosted within meteoritic lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond).
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable photoluminescence across 550-800 nm with a peak at $\sim 700$ nm. Correlative electron microscopy confirmed the lonsdaleite host lattice, suggesting that hexagonal diamond can serve as a new quantum-grade crystalline platform for solid-state quantum emitters.

**43. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To manipulate and observe the spatial evolution of strain-induced helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress.
- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) revealed that the reorientation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) is mediated by magnetic defects via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes. This mechanism shows striking similarity to plastic deformation in metals and demonstrates a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic nanophase control via strain.

- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the emergence and control of Surface Spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) governed by the phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Simulations showed that SS formation is closely linked to the conical phase's in-plane reorientation. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, establishing $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states and potential spintronic functionalities.

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox of metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ synthesis by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: DFT calculations revealed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale by low surface energy, significantly lowering the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) above 60 K in epitaxial nickelate thin films.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset was achieved at $\sim 63$ K in epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity of the films, linking the enhanced superconductivity to strange-metal-like behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$) and identifying the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-$T_c$ system.

- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) denoising pipeline for time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
- **Finding**: The pipeline, which uses a blind-spot convolution neural network, significantly outperformed other methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, improving visual clarity of atomic features in HRTEM images. The model's computational inference speed is in the order of milliseconds, demonstrating excellent out-of-distribution generalization and suitability for high-speed *in situ* HRTEM experiments.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2-\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high-entropy oxides (HEOs) and delineate stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and intermediate phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive characterization suite was used to identify phase boundaries. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction was critical for quantifying crystal structure at multiple length-scales, revealing that quenched kinetic energy in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase with an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice (16.7% vacancies).

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ thin films through interfacial engineering with different perovskite oxide layers.
- **Finding**: Interfacial engineering successfully tuned the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy from partial $d^7$ to partial $d^5$ states. High-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed a clear connection between strain and the resulting spin configuration (e.g., a $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer layer resulted in a Co $d^6$ low spin state), demonstrating that interfacial control governs both orbital occupancy and spin state.

- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize new hexagonal $\text{GeSn}$ alloy classes by subjecting $\text{Ge}$ and $\text{Sn}$ to high pressure and high temperature.
- **Finding**: High-pressure synthesis (9-10 GPa) enabled the ambient pressure recovery of novel hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions ($\text{P}6_3/\text{mmc}$). Precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy confirmed the formation of these hexagonal symmetries below 21 atom % Sn, providing a route to tune optoelectronic properties based on crystal symmetry and stacking sequence.
