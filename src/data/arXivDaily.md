**3. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To comprehensively analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties in $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as a function of $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$), focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and magnetisation data revealed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ decreased below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This microstructural change coincided with a divergence in transport measurements and a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism, shifting from mixed intrinsic/side-jump to skew-scattering dominant, highlighting the interlink between microstructure and Hall transport.

**4. [Absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 revealed by X-ray linear dichroism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06791v1)**
- **Authors**: Siyu Wang, Chao Wang, Yanan Yuan, Jiangxiao Li, Fangfang Pei, Daxiang Liu, Chunyu Qin, Jiefeng Cao, Yamei Wang, Tianye Wang, Jiayu Liu, Jieun Lee, Guanhua Zhang, Christoph Klewe, Chenchao Yu, Fan Zhang, Dongsheng Song, Kai Chen, Weisheng Zhao, Ziqiang Qiu, Mengmeng Yang, Bin Hong, Qian Li
- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To provide clear evidence regarding the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ films, a promising altermagnetic candidate, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
- **Finding**: XLD measurements, combined with photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), showed that the observed XLD signal was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field direction, contradicting predictions for substantial magnetic order. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for $\text{RuO}_2$. PEEM was used in conjunction with XLD to probe the electronic structure and confirmed that distinct XLD signals observed at different edges are due to low-symmetry crystal fields.

- **Authors**: Olga Kaczmarczyk, Konrad Cyprych, Dominika Benkowska-Biernacka, Rafał Kowalczyk, Katarzyna Matczyszyn, Hanglong Wu, Frances M. Ross, Andrzej Miniewicz, Andrzej Żak
- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **Objective**: To perform in situ observations of phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM).
- **Finding**: The electron beam induces consecutive phase changes (Smectic A to Nematic, SmA-N, and Nematic to Isotropic, N-I), which are primarily thermal in nature due to substantial heat generation at higher dose rates. LP-STEM allowed the real-time observation of these transitions, the kinetic dependence on dose rate, and the spontaneous formation of disclinations, providing the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using this technique.

**29. [Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $SrVO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843v1)**
- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a direct and controllable method for recovering the intrinsic metallic surface of $\mathrm{SrVO}_{3}$ ($\mathrm{SVO}$) by thermally reducing the oxidized $\mathrm{V}^{5+}$-rich near-surface region (NSR) under ultra-high vacuum.
- **Finding**: Thermal treatment causes a sharp transformation from a $\mathrm{V}^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states dominated by $\mathrm{V}^{4+}$, restoring the metallic character. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) suggested that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and nanoscale surface reorganization, ruling out a simple $\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ volatilization pathway.

- **Authors**: E. Salahinejad, M. Jafari Baghjeghaz
- **Date**: 2025-12-24
- **Objective**: To synthesize and evaluate the structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability (biomineralization), and biodegradability of novel $\mathrm{Ca-Mg}$ oxyfluorosilicates doped with varying levels of fluoride.
- **Finding**: Samples containing up to 2 mol% F exhibited a single-phase structure of F-doped diopside ($\mathrm{MgCaSi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$), with 1 mol% F identified as the optimal concentration for maximum biomineralization.

**46. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate how varying $\mathrm{Pt/Ru}$ ratios influence the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of $\mathrm{NiCoCrAlYTa}$ coatings modified with $\mathrm{Pt-Ru}$ overlays.
