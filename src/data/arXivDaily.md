**1. [Mind the Gap - Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moirés](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042v1)**
- **Authors**: Harikrishnan KP, Xin Wei, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Ruijuan Xu, Jong-Hoon Kang, Ce Liang, Jiwoong Park, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Objective**: To investigate the challenges of achieving atomic-level coupling at buried interfaces in twisted oxide moirés due to surface roughness and to evaluate characterization methods.
- **Finding**: The study reveals that topographic mismatch from surface roughness significantly restricts atomic-scale proximity at interfaces in twisted oxide moirés, even after eliminating contaminants. In hybrid interfaces, the inability of 2D materials to conform to oxide topography also limits contact. Cross-sectional imaging is crucial for characterizing interface morphology, and **electron ptychography** is shown to reliably resolve nanometer-scale structural variations at buried interfaces, unlike conventional through-focal imaging, highlighting its contribution to understanding interface roughness in oxide twistronics.

**2. [Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320v1)**
- **Authors**: Tim Titze, Sabri Koraltan, Timo Schmidt, Mailin Matthies, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Dieter Suess, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil
- **Date**: 2025-10-24
- **Objective**: To demonstrate control over bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers by engineering stripe domains using in-plane magnetic fields.
- **Finding**: Applying a brief in-plane magnetic field to the stripe state enhances the frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)**, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations revealed that this enhancement is due to field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications of a pure skyrmion lattice. This demonstrates a method for precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics and potentially topology.

- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) analysis in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for measuring spin and orbital magnetic moments at sub-10 nm resolution.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that **Electron Magnetic Circular Dichroism (EMCD)** in **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** can quantitatively measure orbital-to-spin moment ratios ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) in FeRh, consistent with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$ was observed, attributed to instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity. This confirms EMCD's quantitative accuracy under suitable conditions, uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments in functional magnetic materials, which is inaccessible to photon-based methods.

**6. [Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517v2)**
- **Authors**: M. J. Adriaans, J. P. Hoogenboom, A. Mohammadi-Gheidari
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To propose a cost-effective and simple design approach for an electrostatic electron monochromator, addressing the high cost and operational complexity of current designs in scanning electron microscopes.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that current monochromators, based on homogeneous-field deflectors, are extremely sensitive to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections, necessitating complex correcting elements. In contrast, the fringe-field deflector is shown to be less sensitive to these issues. A new, fully electrostatic monochromator design based on pure fringe fields is proposed, which does not require extra correcting elements and achieves optimal energy resolution by including momentary deceleration lenses. This design could be realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies in **electron microscopy**.

By varying model parameters, a large dataset is generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling statistical reconstruction of 3D microstructures from 2D SEM images. An error analysis on key geometrical descriptors quantitatively evaluates the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool, which significantly reduces the cost and time associated with conventional 3D imaging techniques like focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM).

- **Finding**: The study investigated the surface properties of Ga-Cu based liquid metal alloys, observing a shift of the Cu 2p core level to higher binding energies and a shifted/narrowed d-band with decreasing Cu content, attributed to site isolation. At SCALMS reaction conditions (100-500 $^\circ$C), a Cu 2p shift to lower binding energies was observed, tentatively ascribed to bond elongation. **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** images provided evidence for the presence of crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds at low temperatures, explaining the increased Cu surface content. The findings contribute to the insight-driven development of low-temperature melting liquid metals for heterogeneous catalysis.
