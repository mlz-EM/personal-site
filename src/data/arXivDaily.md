- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Veronica Leccese, Ján Rusz, Jon Ander Arregi, Alexey Sapozhnik, Jáchym Štindl, Francesco Barantani, Paolo Cattaneo, Antoine Andrieux, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Fabrizio Carbone, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) analysis, particularly its spatial resolution and accuracy, using the FeRh metamagnetic phase transition as a tunable magnetic reference.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that EMCD can provide quantitative measurements of the orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) consistent with XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$ was observed, attributed to instrumental factors and nanoscale heterogeneity. Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) uniquely enables spatially confined, element-specific measurements of local spin and orbital magnetic moments, allowing the study of interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism inaccessible to photon-based methods.

**2. [Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517v1)**
- **Authors**: M. J. Adriaans, J. H. P. Hoogenboom, A. Mohammadi-Gheidari
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To propose a cost-effective and simpler electrostatic electron monochromator design for electron microscopy and spectroscopy by addressing the extreme sensitivity issues of current designs.
- **Finding**: The authors demonstrate that current monochromators are highly sensitive to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections, often necessitating additional correcting elements. They propose a novel monochromator design based on pure fringe fields, which is less sensitive to these issues and achieves optimal energy resolution by including momentary deceleration lenses, without needing extra correcting elements. This fully electrostatic design, potentially realizable with MEMS technology, offers a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies and enhancing resolution in electron microscopes.

- **Authors**: Léon F. Schröder, Sabrina Weber, Lukas Fuchs, Volker Schmidt, Benedikt Prifling
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To develop a novel approach that predicts the 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes from more accessible 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, thereby overcoming the limitations of costly 3D acquisition methods.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed this atomic-scale accuracy and the periodic arrangement of Cr and V layers. For the first time, the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$ (space group R-3) was stabilized, and its functional properties were compared with density functional theory calculations. This approach, validated by STEM, opens new avenues for tailoring properties of rhombohedral oxides by controlling superlattice composition and period.

Density functional theory calculations confirmed the chemical potential-driven stabilization of Laves phase lamellae. The electron microscopy techniques were essential for visualizing and identifying these intricate defect structures at high resolution, providing critical experimental evidence for the proposed defect landscape and the interplay between site occupancy, dislocation types, and planar faults.

- **Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Objective**: To review and discuss state-of-the-art and challenges in specimen preparation techniques for atom probe tomography (APT) analysis of complex multifunctional nanoparticles and nanostructures, aiming to improve measurement yield and advance APT capabilities.
- **Finding**: The paper highlights that while focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) lift-out procedures enable APT analysis of many materials, they are often unsuitable for nanomaterials. Co-electrodeposition of metallic films is presented as a crucial method for facilitating APT specimen preparation of nanowires, nanosheets, and nano/microparticles by embedding them in a composite. Although electron microscopy techniques (FIB-SEM) are mentioned as a key tool for site-specific lift-out, the paper primarily focuses on the challenges and solutions for preparing diverse nanomaterial specimens for APT, emphasizing the need for improved protocols to enhance measurement yield and advance the understanding of structure-composition-property relationships at near-atomic scales.

- **Finding**: The study introduces structured random models that emulate dense random matrices using a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices, reducing computational complexity from quadratic to log-linear. These models achieve the same robust reconstruction performance as dense random models at low oversampling ratios. While the paper focuses on optical elements, it explicitly states that phase retrieval arises in electron microscopy, implying that these advancements in efficient and robust reconstruction algorithms could be beneficial for electron microscopy applications that rely on phase retrieval, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees.

- **Finding**: The researchers successfully demonstrated KDTh, a technique that precisely fits Kikuchi patterns to deduce temperature changes from local volumetric lattice changes using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). They mapped lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe across the sample, achieving a parameter precision of $\sim$0.01% and a temperature sensitivity of 2.2 K/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. This scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, even surpassing the precision measured in transmission electron microscopy, and can operate in both transmission (TKD) and reflection (EBSD) modes for non-contact nanoscale thermometry.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial for directly resolving the induced heterostrain, lattice deformations, and stacking variations that produce these moiré patterns. The researchers found that uniaxial and biaxial heterostrain give rise to distinct moiré patterns (stripes and distorted hexagonal), and they created in-plane polar distortions and polarization at domain boundaries in MoS$_2$. STEM provided direct atomic-scale visualization, confirming the efficacy of this approach for designing new moiré geometries.

- **Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the surface properties of Ga-Cu based liquid metal alloys, particularly the impact of Cu dilution and reaction conditions, for their potential use in supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS).
- **Finding**: The study found that with decreasing Cu content in Ga-Cu alloys, the Cu 2p core level shifts to higher binding energies, and the d-band narrows, attributed to site isolation. At elevated temperatures (100 and 500 $^\circ$C), a shift of Cu 2p to lower binding energies was observed, tentatively linked to bond elongation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images provided crucial evidence for the increased Cu surface content at low temperatures, attributing it to the presence of crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds. These insights, supported by TEM, contribute to the insight-driven development of low-temperature melting liquid metals for heterogeneous catalysis.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was instrumental in elucidating these nanoparticle formations and surface reorganizations, providing direct visual evidence of the structural engineering. These changes significantly increased Raman intensities in SERS measurements, confirming the enhanced plasmonic hotspot density for ultra-sensitive SERS applications.

- **Date**: 2025-10-08
- **Objective**: To develop a versatile 3D reconstruction framework for hard X-ray grazing incidence imaging of nanostructures, capable of handling significant multiple scattering and recovering complex surface and near-surface structures without strong priors.
- **Finding**: The study presents a ptychographic reconstruction framework that replaces the conventional single-scattering model with a multislice wave-propagation formalism tailored for grazing incidence, enabling the capture of significant multiple scattering. This framework supports simultaneous phase retrieval and reconstruction, incorporates multiple incidence and rotation angles, and allows initialization from a random guess, facilitating the recovery of complex surface and near-surface nanostructures. While focused on X-ray imaging, the advancements in 3D reconstruction and wave-propagation formalism could potentially inform and inspire similar developments in electron microscopy, especially for coherent imaging techniques that deal with strong scattering and require high-resolution 3D reconstruction of nanoscale features.

- **Authors**: Alexander Blackston, Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Sevim Polat Genlik, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Roberto C. Myers
- **Date**: 2025-10-06
- **Objective**: To experimentally test predictions of 1D dispersive electronic bands confined to atomic-scale dislocation cores in the wide bandgap semiconductor ZnS.
- **Finding**: The study correlated sub-bandgap optical transitions with the density of dislocations in epitaxial ZnS. **Scanning electron microscopy-based electron channeling contrast imaging** was used to quantify the densities of four predicted partial dislocations. Room-temperature ellipsometry and low-temperature photoluminescence revealed absorption and deep emission peaks consistent with theoretical predictions for dislocation 1D band-to-band transitions. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy further supported these findings, showing distinct excitation dependencies for dislocation-assigned peaks, indicating efficient 1D radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core states.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To report a unique phase of indium selenide, named the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase, which exhibits room temperature ferroelectricity in a van der Waals material.
- **Finding**: A novel $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide was identified in large-area films using **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** analysis. Cross-sectional STEM revealed unique zigzag atomic configurations with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths and intralayer shifting, indicating broken inversion symmetry. Films with $\beta^\text{p}$ layers displayed electric-field-induced switchable polarization, characteristic of ferroelectric materials, a conclusion further supported by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a low-dimensional van der Waals material at room temperature.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To report and investigate the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface.
- **Finding**: **Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM)** measurements revealed spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments ruled out artifacts or chirality-induced spin selectivity. Spin-polarized density functional theory and an extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model attributed the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface.

**31. [Observation of a Novel CDW Superstructure in Monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at Room Temperature and its Evolution in Multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03800v1)**
- **Authors**: Samanta Pal, Kaustuv Chatterjee, A. K. Raychaudhuri, Prabir Pal
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To investigate the spontaneous formation and evolution of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayer and multilayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at room temperature.
- **Finding**: A novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1$^\circ$ was discovered in monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at room temperature. **High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)** and **electron diffraction (ED)** were used to observe the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases and to characterize the CDW order. With increasing layers, the CDW order evolved into a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure, attributed to vanadium self-intercalation as $V^{3+}$ ions in multilayer $VS_{2}$ as shown by angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy.

- **Authors**: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To conduct an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation and the short-to-long crack transition in a cold-worked 5052 aluminium alloy.
- **Finding**: The study utilized in-situ **scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC)** and **electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)**, combined with data-driven crystal plasticity modeling, to characterize crack propagation. It was found that microstructure-sensitive cracks grow in a quasi-brittle manner at low energy release rates until a critical energy release rate is reached, at which point plastic deformation blunts the crack, marking a transition from elastically-driven to plasticity-dominated crack arrest. This establishes the short-to-long crack transition as process-zone governed.

- **Authors**: Faisal Kimbugwe, Marzieh Baan, Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Roberto C Myers, Tyler J Grassman
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize the epitaxial growth of thermodynamically unstable wüstite FeO films on 4H-SiC substrates using molecular beam epitaxy.
- **Finding**: Up to 180 nm thick $(111)$-oriented FeO heteroepitaxial films were successfully grown on 4H-SiC$(0001)$. **X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)** collectively confirmed the epilayer as phase-pure wüstite FeO with atomically sharp FeO/SiC interfaces. The films exhibited a slight misfit strain-induced rhombohedral distortion. This demonstrates the power of epitaxial stabilization for integrating thermodynamically unstable but functionally interesting materials with commercially available semiconductor platforms.

- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a novel mechanism for tuning the strain state in $V_{2}O_{3}$ thin films by controlling substrate morphology, thereby influencing its metal-insulator transition.
- **Finding**: The study found that minute changes in sapphire substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped) can relax compressive strain from lattice mismatch, allowing thermally-induced tensile strain to dominate in $V_{2}O_{3}$ films. This leads to either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases across all temperatures, with resistivity differences spanning many orders of magnitude. **High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM)** was used to image atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in $V_{2}O_{3}$, elucidating the strain relaxation mechanism.

- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a proof-of-concept for contactless electrostatic actuation of interlayer twist in 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures using electron-beam-induced charge injection.
- **Finding**: The researchers achieved angular displacement by locally charging an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on a grounded graphene layer with an electron beam, creating an interfacial electric field and in-plane electrostatic torque. The induced rotation was validated through in-situ **scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This method offers a contactless and scalable approach for dynamically controlling the relative orientation of layers in vdW heterostructures, critical for reconfigurable nanoscale devices.

- **Authors**: Chih-Yu Lee, Yi-Siou Huang, Felix Adams, Chuanyu Lian, Hongyi Sun, Jie Zhao, Zichao Ye, Nathan Youngblood, Juejun Hu, Leslie H Allen, Yifei Mo, Ichiro Takeuchi, Carlos A Rios Ocampo
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of Si doping into $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ to tailor its properties as an optical phase change material (OPCM), aiming for improved transparency and reduced power consumption.
- **Finding**: Magnetron co-sputtering was used to incorporate Si into $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ films. **Ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy** were employed to characterize the optical properties and crystal structure. Experiments showed that 20% Si doping increased the transparency window in both amorphous and crystalline states, particularly to 800 nm (1.55 eV) in the amorphous phase, and reduced power consumption by lowering the melting temperature. However, this came at the cost of reduced refractive index contrast and slower phase transition kinetics.

**38. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: To introduce aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) as a method to improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging, especially in the presence of higher-order aberrations.
- **Finding**: Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM methods (tcBF, tcDPC) are useful at low dose but their contrast transfer functions (CTF) are strongly damped by higher-order aberrations. This paper shows that acBF, which combines tcBF and tcDPC, enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even with higher-order aberrations. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF CTF. The method was demonstrated on both simulated and experimental **4D-STEM** data, showing superior performance to tcBF or DPC alone.

- **Objective**: To develop a deep learning framework for automated and efficient polarization domain mapping in ferroelectric materials using 4D-STEM data.
- **Finding**: The study presents a convolutional neural network that, with minimal training, classifies polarization directions from diffraction data and segments domains in real space. An adaptive sampling strategy was introduced to prioritize images from domain wall regions, reducing training data requirements and improving accuracy. This approach was demonstrated for domain mapping in ferroelectric boracite, $Cu_{3}B_{7}O_{13}Cl$, showcasing how **4D-STEM** combined with deep learning can overcome the computational intensity and manual interpretation challenges of conventional analysis for atomic-scale domain identification.

It was observed that the TMD shell morphology could be controlled by optimizing the selenization temperature, attributed to different growth mechanisms. This work provides insights into controlling TMD shell growth on nanowires, offering promising avenues for advanced nanoscale optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

- **Authors**: Naisargi Kanabar, Seiichiro Higashiya, Daniele Cherniak, Devendra Sadana, Stephen Bedell, Haralabos Efstathiadis
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Objective**: To examine lithium distribution and its evolution in both anode and cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate cycling.
- **Finding**: Post-mortem analysis of cells cycled at 1C to 3C rates was performed using Li nuclear reaction analysis (Li-NRA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and **scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)**. Li-NRA revealed a surface lithium peak on the anode (likely associated with SEI formation and lithium plating) and a decrease in lithium content in the cathode. XRD analysis of the cathode showed c-lattice parameter contraction and peak shifts consistent with lithium depletion and structural deformation, supported by **SEM imaging**. High C-rate cycling also led to capacity fade and increased internal resistance, highlighting the impact of lithium plating on cell performance.

- **Authors**: Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and corresponding microstructure on the electrical resistivity of overaged Al-Mg-Si alloys.
- **Finding**: The study characterized crystal structure, composition, and microstructure using **X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy**. The electrical resistivity of microstructural components (Al solid solution matrix, Si, and $Mg_{2}Si$ precipitates) was directly measured using a microscale four-point probe setup inside a **scanning electron microscope**. It was found that the Al solid solution matrix was up to 15% more resistive than pure Al, depending on heat treatment, and regions including Si or $Mg_{2}Si$ precipitates were equally resistive.

- **Authors**: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric $SrTiO_{3}$ and understand its real-space structure.
- **Finding**: Using **cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** down to 20 K, the researchers directly imaged the low-temperature polar structure of $SrTiO_{3}$. High-resolution imaging revealed a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains of finite polarization. These short-range polar domains initially grew and self-organized into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers, but this process reversed below 40 K (in the quantum paraelectric regime), causing the periodically ordered polar nanodomains to fragment into small clusters.

- **Authors**: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman
- **Date**: 2025-09-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the viability of image reconstruction in position-blind ptychography, where scan positions are unknown and must be recovered jointly with the image.
- **Finding**: This work addresses the challenging inverse problem of ptychographic phase retrieval without prior knowledge of scan positions. The viability of image reconstruction was investigated in a simulated 2-D variant using variational inference with data-driven image priors (score-based diffusion models). The study found that with appropriate illumination structure and a strong prior, reliable and successful image reconstructions can be achieved even under measurement noise, except in the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario. While not directly using electron microscopy, the principles are relevant to advanced imaging techniques, including **electron ptychography**.

Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling observed in $RuO_{2}/Fe$ bilayer heterostructures, challenging its attribution to altermagnetism in $RuO_{2}$.
- **Finding**: The study used polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron reflectometry, **cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy**, and SQUID measurements to investigate EB in Ru-capped $RuO_{2}/Fe$ bilayers. The experiments revealed that the EB behavior is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing $Fe_{3}O_{4}$, which undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature. These findings were confirmed by comparable measurements of Ni-based heterostructures (no EB) and additional Fe/Ru bilayers (oxide-driven EB without epitaxial $RuO_{2}$), suggesting interfacial chemical disorder as the cause.

- **Finding**: The study details a new cryogenic cooling system for JEOL S/TEMs, utilizing compressed liquid helium to achieve stable base temperatures of 6.58 K with minimal fluctuations. In-situ **electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)** via aluminum bulk plasmon analysis was used to measure local specimen temperature and validate cryogenic operation. The platform's integration with other **electron microscopy** techniques was demonstrated by resolving charge density wave (CDW) transitions in $NbSe_{2}$ using **electron diffraction** and imaging nanometric magnetic skyrmions in MnSi via **Lorentz TEM**. This system provides a reliable, low-drift route for direct visualization of electronic and magnetic phase transformations in quantum materials below 7 K.

- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten and the sublimation of tungsten oxide to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
- **Finding**: Pure W was oxidized at temperatures between 400 and 1050$^\circ$C. The formation of voids and cracks above 600$^\circ$C led to dust or oxide spalling, which is problematic for fusion power plant maintenance. Preferential oxidation at specimen edges was characterized. Characterization using **electron microscopy** and Raman spectroscopy revealed a three-layer oxide scale: an inner 30-50 nm thick $WO_{2}$ layer, a middle 10-20 $\mu$m $WO_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer $WO_{2.9}/WO_{3}$ layer whose thickness varied. The observed microstructure was discussed in relation to parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.

**49. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that can overcome the limitations of speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging.
- **Finding**: The work first proves that SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes is fundamentally impossible with sequential measurements suffering from per-measurement-independent speckle. It then develops a snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome this. Remarkably, simulations demonstrate that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, thereby improving resolution. This paper focuses on light-based imaging and does not directly involve electron microscopy techniques.
