**1. [Fabrication of Dense Ultrafine-Grained MoW, MoWNb, and MoWNbTa Alloys: Influence of Cobalt Doping on Sintering and Grain Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00246v1)**
- **Authors**: Keyu Cao, Sashank Shivakumar, Jian Luo
- **Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Objective**: To fabricate dense ultrafine-grained MoW-based refractory alloys and investigate the influence of cobalt doping on their sintering behavior and high-temperature grain growth resistance.
- **Finding**: Cobalt doping (2 at.%) enhanced relative densities (up to $96-98\%$) via activated sintering and significantly suppressed the relative grain growth rate, an effect consistent with the high-entropy grain boundary (HEGB) concept. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed strong Co segregation at the grain boundaries, supporting the proposed grain boundary segregation model.

- **Authors**: Olga Kaczmarczyk, Konrad Cyprych, Dominika Benkowska-Biernacka, Rafał Kowalczyk, Katarzyna Matczyszyn, Hanglong Wu, Frances M. Ross, Andrzej Miniewicz, Andrzej Żak
- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **Objective**: To perform in situ observations of phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM).

- **Authors**: Abby Liu, Zhucong Xi, Xiaobo Chen, Catherine Huang, Meng Li, Judith C. Yang, Liang Qi, Dmitri N. Zakharov, Rachel S. Goldman
- **Date**: 2025-12-17
- **Objective**: To elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms governing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of gallium nitride ($\text{GaN}$) from $\text{Ga}$ droplet arrays using real-time environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM).
- **Finding**: E-TEM revealed that at low temperatures, $\text{GaN}$ growth occurs preferentially at pre-existing $\text{GaN}$ nuclei, likely due to reduced Gibbs free energy for $\text{NH}_3$ decomposition at $\text{Ga/GaN}$ interfaces. At intermediate to high temperatures, nucleation and growth occur with enhanced crystallinity due to epitaxial templating. These results highlight the critical role of the $\text{Ga/GaN}$ interface in facilitating $\text{GaN}$ formation.

- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate how a scandium nitride ($\text{ScN}$) buffer layer affects the superconducting and structural properties of thin niobium nitride ($\text{NbN}$) films.
- **Finding**: The $\text{ScN}$ buffer layer significantly improved the characteristics of 29 nm thick $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing the critical temperature ($T_c$) from 9 K to 12.5 K and decreasing resistivity. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction confirmed that this enhancement is due to the better lattice matching between $\text{NbN}$ and $\text{ScN}$, resulting in a higher quality crystal lattice in the $\text{NbN}$ film.

- **Objective**: To report and investigate a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in ferroelectric $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ at room temperature, tracing its origin to direct current drift issues.
- **Finding**: The drift is caused by defect-bound unpaired electrons whose polarization relaxation is quenched by magnetic-field-induced skyrmion states. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) directly visualized the formation of these room-temperature skyrmion states. This collective spin ordering transforms the defects into a magnetically responsive platform, exhibiting an enhanced EO efficiency up to 34 pm/V in $\text{LiNbO}_3$, and demonstrating a significant adjustment of the EO coefficient (about 8 pm/V) under a 0.1 T magnetic field.

- **Authors**: A. A. Shiryaev, E. F. Vasilev, A. L. Vasilev, V. V. Artemov, N. V. Gubanov, D. A. Zedgenizov
- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural features and spectroscopic properties of a natural diamond crystal containing Y-defects.
- **Finding**: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis of the Y-defect zone revealed various configurations of dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects. Extended defects, identified as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) with dimensions up to 20 nm, were observed. These voids are suggested to form via the annihilation of dislocation dipoles and subsequent vacancy consumption. The observed irregular temporal variations (blinking) of photoluminescence lines are hypothesized to be caused by recombination processes occurring at the internal walls of these newly discovered nanovoids.

- **Date**: 2025-12-12
- **Objective**: To introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for the synthesis of high-quality single crystals of elemental and compound quantum materials at the micrometer scale.
- **Finding**: This nanoconfined synthesis technique successfully grew isolated single crystals, including elemental tellurium and distinct $\text{Pd-Te}$ compounds. Atomic-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) confirmed the high crystalline quality of the products. The method enabled the synthesis of non-stoichiometric $\text{PdTe}_{1-x}$ ($x \sim 0.18$) which retained uniform crystallinity and exhibited superconductivity below 3.8 K, demonstrating a powerful new pathway for quantum materials discovery.

- **Authors**: Connie M. Wang, Roberta M. Sabino, Aditya Garg, Ahmed E. Salih, Loza F. Tadesse, Elazer R. Edelman
- **Date**: 2025-12-12
- **Objective**: To develop a multifunctional, self-sensing implant material composed of gold nano-columns ($\text{AuNCs}$) patterned on a titanium surface ($\text{AuNC-Ti}$) to serve as a Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrate for non-invasive monitoring of tissue-material interactions.
- **Finding**: $\text{AuNC-Ti}$ substrates were fabricated using oblique angle deposition (OAD). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed the uniform formation of $\text{AuNCs}$ ($360 \pm 40$ nm length, $50 \pm 16$ nm width). The substrate exhibited high biocompatibility and a significant SERS enhancement factor ($\text{EF} = 1.8 \times 10^5$), enabling the spatial identification of biological components at the implant interface using confocal Raman imaging.

- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of temperature and thickness on ferroelastic domain wall (DW) morphology and dynamics in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films using *in situ* heating and machine-learning-driven image analysis.
- **Finding**: *In situ* heating Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) revealed a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness. In the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm), DWs are mobile and curved near the critical temperature ($T_C$) and freeze upon cooling. Conversely, in the crossover regime (200-300 nm), DWs are nearly static with significantly lower curvature, mapping the evolution across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes.

**38. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform direct real-space imaging of nanometric skyrmion lattices using Fresnel Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) and to establish the quantitative limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall skyrmions.
- **Finding**: Conventional analysis of defocus-dependent Fresnel images resulted in an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon. Systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations attributed this chiral misinterpretation to the sinusoidal modulation of the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF), which strongly depends on both defocus values and skyrmion dimensions. This work reveals fundamental insights into phase-to-intensity conversion processes in nanoscale magnetic imaging.

**39. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies (topological-Hall-like signals) observed in a $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet, whose related compounds were previously suggested to host chiral spin textures.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they lacked the characteristic correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions typically seen in topological Hall systems. Crucially, Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) measurements definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in the ferrimagnet. The anomalies are therefore attributed to trivial mechanisms, specifically the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity, prompting a re-evaluation of transport-based evidence for skyrmions in bulk systems.

**40. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust, constraint-free phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) that eliminates the need for object-specific constraints, addressing the instability and ill-posedness of reconstruction.
- **Finding**: CDIP utilizes untrained coordinate-based neural fields combined with a physics-consistent forward model for both static and dynamic reconstructions. The framework substantially outperformed classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability on simulated and experimental datasets. This approach provides a broadly applicable framework for coherent imaging modalities, including those using electron probes like ptychography and holography.

**41. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings, integrating analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and experimental validation.
- **Finding**: Analytical models predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings. *In situ* Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) experiments on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation. The results demonstrate that strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the primary mechanism governing the manipulation of 3D skyrmion strings, offering a route for energy-efficient spintronic applications.

**42. [Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09067v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To investigate and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models used for High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) imaging, particularly with respect to varying imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: Using synthetic HRTEM data generated via multislice simulation, the study developed a framework based on the HRTEM Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) to quantify OOD domain shifts. It was demonstrated that while neural network segmentation models show significant performance stability, their performance smoothly and predictably degrades as imaging conditions shift away from the training distribution, providing a quantitative measure for reliability in experimental workflows.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the critical influence of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_u$) and magnetization of $\text{(Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnet alloys.
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) revealed a significant compressive strain, up to 25%, near grain boundaries in the $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys. Calculations showed that while $K_u$ is positive under strain-free conditions (4.2 $\text{MJ/m}^3$ at 0 K), it becomes negative in regions subjected to 25% compressive strain. The results highlight that lattice distortions severely degrade $K_u$, especially in Pr-rich alloys, providing crucial input for designing advanced magnetic materials.

- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence of optically active, photoluminescent color centers in lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond), a wide-bandgap host.
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in meteoritic lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable emission across 550–800 nm with a 14 ns excited-state lifetime. Correlative electron microscopy confirmed the lonsdaleite host lattice structure. The stability and brightness suggest that lonsdaleite could serve as a new quantum-grade crystalline platform, establishing a potentially new family of solid-state quantum emitters.

**45. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To observe and understand the spatial evolution and mechanism of helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress in chiral magnets.
- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) revealed that the reorientation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) is mediated by magnetic topological defects, analogous to plastic deformation in metals. The mechanisms observed include "break-and-reconnect" and "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes. Simulations suggest that strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the key driver, offering a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic nanophase control.

**46. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the magnetic textures, specifically Surface Spirals (SS), that emerge at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) in chiral magnets, focusing on control by the intrinsic in-plane phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that $\phi_0$ acts as a fundamental control parameter, governing the presence, shape, and topological charge of SSs at 1D FCIs. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed the formation of SSs at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, revealing formation via thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation.

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox concerning the synthesis of the metastable solid-state electrolyte $\alpha-\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: Computational and experimental data showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of the nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation, providing a rational strategy for synthesizing functional metastable materials.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelate thin films with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) exceeding the previously observed $\sim 40$ K limit.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset at $\sim 63$ K was achieved in epitaxial $\text{(La,Pr)}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium growth method (GAE). Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity of the highly metastable, strained superconducting phase. The films exhibited a systematic transition from Fermi-liquid-like ($\alpha \sim 2$) to strange-metal-like ($\alpha \sim 1$) behavior as $T_c$ increased, identifying nickelates as an anisotropic 3D high-$T_c$ system.

**49. [Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04045v1)**
- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) denoising pipeline suitable for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and out-of-distribution (OOD) time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images, enabling high-speed *in situ* analysis.
- **Finding**: The pipeline, which uses a blind-spot convolution neural network, significantly outperformed other denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, improving the visual clarity of atomic features. Crucially, the model demonstrated excellent OOD generalization and a computational inference speed in the order of milliseconds per image, making it fast enough for real-time application in low-dose *in situ* HRTEM experiments.

- **Authors**: Billy E. Yang, Saeed S. I. Almishal, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Mary Kathleen Caucci, Gerald Bejger, Christina M. Rost, Nasim Alem, Susan B. Sinnott, Jon-Paul Maria
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2-\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and resolve the stability regions of bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and intermediate vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive multi-length-scale characterization suite, including Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, was critical for identifying the boundaries between the closely related phases. TEM confirmed the crystal structure across the formulation space. Furthermore, thin film studies demonstrated that kinetic quenching can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase even with an exceptionally high estimated oxygen vacancy concentration (16.7%), providing guidelines for targeted synthesis of functional metastable HEO structures.
