- **Date**: 2025-08-06
- **Objective**: To investigate a straightforward method for determining the crystallographic orientation of black phosphorus (BP) from bulk crystals to thin layers using angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) with a standard single-wavelength Raman setup.
- **Finding**: The study developed an ARPRS approach, incorporating thickness-dependent interference effects and anisotropic optical indices, which provides a reliable framework for orientation determination across different BP thicknesses using a 514 nm Raman setup. The method was validated through direct orientation measurements using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD), confirming its applicability to both thick and ultrathin samples. This offers a practical solution for characterizing BP orientation without requiring advanced structural characterization techniques.

- **Authors**: Shuo Chen, Yijin Li, Xi Zheng, Guofeng Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid method for 3D surface reconstruction of microstructures from multi-view, multi-detector 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, addressing limitations of existing methods.

**35. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, specifically La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.
- **Finding**: Using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the study found that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, ensuring near-stoichiometry and bulk superconductivity under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induced a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers into p-d hybridized orbitals, ultimately suppressing superconductivity. This finding, critically revealed by advanced electron microscopy techniques, highlights a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, distinct from cuprate superconductors.

- **Authors**: Mingyu Liu, Zian Mao, Zhu Liu, Haoran Zhang, Jintao Guo, Xiaoya He, Xi Huang, Shufen Chu, Chun Cheng, Jun Ding, Yujun Xie
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To develop an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline, 4D-PreNet, for preprocessing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to address pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline integrating attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration on 4D-STEM data. Trained on large simulated datasets, the network generalized effectively to experimental data, reducing mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieving sub-pixel center localization with average errors below 0.04 pixels. This framework significantly improves both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

**37. [Experimental evidence of disordered crystalline premixing in sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01484v1)**
- **Authors**: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: To directly measure the premixed phase at the interfaces of sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which are known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions.
- **Finding**: The study provided direct experimental evidence, via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), of a disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers. This crystalline phase differs from previously reported a priori predictions of an amorphous interlayer. The disordered FCC phase retained its symmetry after annealing for 16 h at $135~^\circ\text{C}$, with the lattice parameter shifting consistent with an Al-rich composition, attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization. STEM was crucial for atomic-scale characterization of this interface.

- **Authors**: Maurits Vuijk, Johannes Zeininger, Luis Sandoval, Günther Rupprechter, Beatriz Roldan Cuenya, Karsten Reuter, Thomas Lunkenbein, Christoph Scheurer
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Objective**: To implement a custom-designed automation interface for Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) to enable dual-magnification imaging by frame alternation, allowing simultaneous collection of interlaced data sets at different length scales.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed an automation interface for ESEM that minimizes human supervision and allows for the collection of multiple interlaced data sets simultaneously. By using automation to change the acquisition settings after each frame, they successfully captured alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location, providing both a low-magnification overview of mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high-magnification field of view of ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif in a catalytic system. This dual-magnification ESEM imaging provides truly correlative data to establish cross-scale correlations about catalytic systems.

- **Date**: 2025-07-31
- **Objective**: To explore the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings, investigating the sensitivity of conical diffraction and diffuse scattering patterns to grating structure and morphology.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that synchrotron measurements in grazing incidence geometry can simultaneously measure conical diffraction and diffuse scattering on a grating. The diffraction component of the pattern was shown to be sensitive to the average groove profile of the gratings, while the diffuse scattering depended on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface. These findings were supported by numerical simulations and validated with data from atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, highlighting synchrotron measurements as a powerful nanometrology tool for modern optical elements.

Heitmann, Matthias Frontzek, William D. Ratcliff, Gregory T. McCandless, Julia Y. Chan, Elton J. G. Santos, Jeehoon Kim, Charudatta M. Phatak, Vadym Kulichenko, Luis Balicas
- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ to understand its high Curie temperature, low dimensionality, and the presence of topological spin textures.
- **Finding**: Through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, the study revealed that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking while maintaining global inversion symmetry, providing a convincing explanation for the presence of Néel skyrmions observed via Lorentz-TEM. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicated a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase transition to a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, challenging previous claims. The observation of magnetic bubbles via magnetic force microscopy at the magnetic phase boundary suggests skyrmions stabilized by the competition among magnetic phases and distinct exchange interactions, with TEM and Lorentz-TEM being crucial for structural and spin texture analysis.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To develop and apply a high-throughput spectro-ptychography methodology to visualize local Ni oxidation state behavior in single-crystal NMC811 cathodes with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, using it as a proxy for state-of-charge and chemical degradation.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed a high-throughput data collection strategy enabling 2D and 3D ptychography in minutes, combined with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), to map Ni oxidation state variations in single-crystal NMC811. This technique allowed direct mapping of chemical degradation along Li channels, identification of nucleation sites, and observation of Ni oxidation state heterogeneities across both electrode and particle scales during lifetime cycling to high voltages. The findings, obtained through advanced X-ray microscopy, were correlated with the formation and growth of the rocksalt phase and oxygen-induced planar gliding, advancing the fundamental understanding of high-Ni layered oxide degradation.

- **Objective**: To realize Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) nanowaveguides and experimentally observe second harmonic generation (SHG) in these structures, demonstrating their potential for integrated nonlinear photonics.
- **Finding**: The study successfully fabricated ZnS nanowaveguides from RF magnetron sputtered thin films, which were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ellipsometry. Theoretical analysis confirmed their suitability for second-order nonlinear processes. The experimental observation of SHG in these nanowaveguides establishes ZnS as a promising platform for compact and integrated frequency conversion devices, with SEM providing crucial morphological characterization of the fabricated structures.

- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize cobalt ferrite (CoFe$_2$O$_4$) nanoparticles for white LED-based photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.
- **Finding**: Cobalt ferrite (CoFe$_2$O$_4$) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via the sol-gel method and annealed at $500~^\circ\text{C}$. The nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman, and Infrared spectroscopy for structural analysis. The material exhibited semiconducting behavior with a narrow bandgap, enabling 95% decomposition of methyl orange and methylene blue aqueous solutions under white LED irradiation within 150 minutes, with further improvement upon adding hydrogen peroxide. SEM provided essential morphological characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles.

**44. [Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data and identify new imaging modes.
- **Finding**: The study showed that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk (tcBF and tcDPC) enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximizes 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond WPOA, they identified contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which can be enhanced at selected frequencies under overfocus conditions. A tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) was also constructed, summing incoherent scattering components for depth sectioning. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory to 4D-STEM, providing analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography.

Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps.
- **Finding**: The study used X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses to show how processing steps, such as pressing and heat treatment, play distinct roles in defect evolution in SCNCs. Pressing led to distortion of the fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yielded supraparticles with stacking faults. Notably, heat treatment caused stacking faults to migrate and heal, as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries underwent structural changes. In-situ STEM was crucial for observing these dynamic rearrangements of defects at the supercrystalline scale, providing new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered nanoparticle assemblies.

- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To directly image the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation.
- **Finding**: The researchers used Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation to directly image the real-time formation of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. They observed a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state, and short-lived DWs forming and spontaneously vanishing within picoseconds in a narrow fluence window. Multiscale simulations revealed a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state. Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy was essential for visualizing these femtosecond-scale magnetic domain wall dynamics, establishing a framework for controlling spin textures.

**47. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, addressing limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that while the CTF overestimates practical performance, SSNR provides a more accurate, dose-aware metric for STEM phase retrieval. Using numerical reconstructions, they showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs with analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography showed a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography, while at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds. This work highlights the importance of SSNR for assessing STEM phase retrieval performance, especially in low-dose regimes.

- **Authors**: Elizaveta Gangrskaia, Thomas Schachinger, Christoph Eisenmenger-Sittner, Lorenz Grünewald, Sebastian Mai, Andrius Baltuška, Audrius Pugžlys, Alessandra Bellissimo
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology to enhance and achieve high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation for probing magnetic dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ ions.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed a setup using spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses optimized for selective excitation of magnetic and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. In the presence of the metallic antenna, excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam provided at least a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition compared to other beams. While electron microscopy is not the primary technique, nanoscale sample engineering, which often relies on EM for characterization and fabrication validation, is a key component of this work.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the arrangement of dipoles within polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films to understand self-organized polar textures at the atomic scale.
- **Finding**: Using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film in plan view orientation, the study revealed that within irreducibly narrow polar layers, dipoles form strikingly non-uniform, atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls. These walls, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, adopt distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-nm$^2$ footprint, representing some of the smallest domains reported in polar materials. This work, critically enabled by atomic-scale STEM, provides the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls nested within self-organized polar nonpolar layering.

- **Authors**: Pengcheng Li, Chenglin Pua, Zehao Dong, Zhengxiong Su, Tao Liu, Chao Cai, Huahai Shen, Lin Gu, Zhen Chen
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop and demonstrate multislice electron ptychography (MEP) as a transformative method for precisely determining the atomic-scale distribution of hydrogen in metal hydrides, overcoming limitations of conventional techniques.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes challenges in hydrogen detection by offering exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work establishes MEP as a powerful electron microscopy technique for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties, which was previously challenging due to hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility.
