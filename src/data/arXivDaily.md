- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To investigate how a $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer improves the growth of co-evaporated perovskite films on textured silicon bottom cells for high-efficiency tandem solar cells.
- **Finding**: The $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation across the $\text{MeO-2PACz/perovskite}$ interface, preventing the formation of interfacial $\text{PbI}_2$ and leading to larger apparent grains, resulting in a certified tandem cell efficiency of $29.7\%$. $\text{X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM)}$ and $\text{infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM)}$ were crucial in revealing that the seed layer homogenizes precursor incorporation, even in areas with thin hole-transporting material.

- **Authors**: Muxian Xu, Siyu Cheng, Andrea Capa Salinas, Ganesh Pokharel, Alexander LaFleur, Hong Li, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Qinwen Deng, Binghai Yan, Ziqiang Wang, Stephen D. Wilson, Ilija Zeljkovic
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: To determine whether electronic nematicity in the kagome superconductor $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$ is intrinsically linked to the $2 \times 2$ charge density wave ($\text{CDW}$) phase or represents the parent electronic state.
- **Finding**: Using $\text{spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)}$ on doped $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$ samples where the $2 \times 2$ $\text{CDW}$ was suppressed, the researchers discovered that rotational symmetry breaking (electronic nematicity) persisted ubiquitously in short-range nanoscale regions across a wide doping range. This finding establishes electronic nematicity as the intrinsic parent state of kagome superconductors, independent of the long-range $2 \times 2$ $\text{CDW}$ order.

- **Date**: 2025-11-25
- **Objective**: To achieve direct, nanometer-resolution real-space imaging of moiré-confined excitons within the unit cell of twisted bilayer $\text{MoS}_2$.
- **Finding**: $\text{Room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy (AFM)}$ successfully imaged excitons across the moiré pattern of $2^\text{o}$ twisted bilayer $\text{MoS}_2$ with nanometer resolution. The technique directly resolved site-selective confinement, showing that direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, providing crucial constraints for microscopic models of moiré excitons.

- **Authors**: Shreyashi Sinha, Shantanu Pathak, Saswata Bhattacharya, Sujit Manna
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To reliably fabricate pristine ultrathin flakes of 3D topological insulators ($\text{Bi}_{0.1}\text{Sb}_{0.9}\text{Te}_3$) and resolve the quantum well states ($\text{QWS}$) of Dirac electrons driven by quantum confinement.
- **Finding**: High-resolution $\text{scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)}$ performed on atomically flat exfoliated flakes revealed clear $\text{QWS}$ of Dirac electrons, an effect rarely observed due to Klein tunneling resistance. $\text{Atomically resolved scanning probe microscopy}$ confirmed the pristine quality, and spatially resolved spectroscopy around defects further confirmed that the $\text{QWS}$ remain robust against defect scattering.

**7. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize "e-coherent" crystalline interfaces where local non-affine relaxations enhance coherency by introducing additional coincidence sites.
- **Finding**: E-coherency is achieved through non-affine transformations that introduce unique line defects called "discohesions," which cannot have long-range stress fields. $\text{Atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)}$ demonstrated that the energetics and kinetics of these interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content, suggesting that e-coherency is a pervasive and fundamentally different behavior compared to non-e-coherent interfaces.

- **Finding**: By utilizing momentum-transfer-dependent $\text{electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)}$ in $\text{STEM}$, the researchers directly visualized the $\text{Mn}-3d\ e_g$ orbital polarization with sub-angstrom precision in strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_3$ thin films. This approach validated that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^2-r^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^2-y^2$, achieving the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity.

- **Objective**: To investigate the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductor $\text{CsBi}_2$ and spin liquid $\text{Pr}_2\text{Ir}_2\text{O}_7$ using atomic-scale probes.
- **Finding**: $\text{Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)}$ measurements at $0.3\ \text{K}$ provided atomically resolved images and $\text{tunneling spectroscopy}$. In $\text{CsBi}_2$, a hexagonal vortex lattice with three-fold symmetry cores was observed under magnetic field. In $\text{Pr}_2\text{Ir}_2\text{O}_7$, a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance was found, which exhibited a three-fold spatial modulation and atomic site-dependent Zeeman splitting, offering insights into frustration effects.

**10. [Probing Boundary Spins in the $\text{Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard}$ model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17173v1)**
- **Authors**: Armando A. Aligia, Alejandro M. Lobos, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Claudio J. Gazza
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Objective**: To propose an experimental methodology using scanning tunneling microscopy ($\text{STM}$) combined with electron spin resonance ($\text{ESR}$) to detect localized boundary spins in the $\text{Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard}$ chain.
- **Finding**: The theoretical proposal suggests that when the $\text{STM}$ tip is in contact with the chain end, the coupling creates an effective Anderson impurity problem, manifesting as a low-bias Kondo peak. Spatially resolving the width of this Kondo resonance as the $\text{STM}$ tip approaches the chain ends provides a clear, indirect signature of the localized boundary spins, supported by $\text{DMRG}$ calculations.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate and characterize a tungsten ($\text{W}$) doping-induced structural phase transition between semiconducting polytypes in bilayer ($\text{2L}$) $\text{MoS}_2$.
- **Finding**: Increasing W concentration in $\text{CVD}$-grown $\text{2L}$ $\text{MoS}_2$ induces a phase transition from non-centrosymmetric $\text{AA}$ stacking to centrosymmetric $\text{AB'}$ stacking, evidenced by a vanishing polarization-resolved $\text{SHG}$ signal and stiffening of the layer-breathing Raman mode. $\text{Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM)}$ was used to map the spatial distribution of W concentration and directly observe the associated structural changes.

- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy method for accurately determining the twist angle in artificially stacked $\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$ (BSCCO) cuprate heterostructures.
- **Finding**: By analyzing the twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, particularly the out-of-plane $\text{A}_{1g}$ mode of $\text{Bi/Sr}$ at $116\ \text{cm}^{-1}$, clear optical fingerprints of rotational misalignment were identified. This non-invasive Raman approach provides a reliable method for characterizing the critical twist angle, avoiding the structural damage often inflicted by conventional techniques like $\text{electron microscopy}$ or $\text{scanning probe techniques}$.

- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To establish a correlative framework linking operando structural dynamics with atomic-scale interfacial chemistry to understand phase transformations in Pt-based alloying anodes.
- **Finding**: The initial lithiation forms $\text{Li}_2\text{Pt}$ which evolves into a stable $\text{LiPt}$ intermetallic phase via a solid solution mechanism. $\text{Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)}$ and $\text{electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)}$ confirmed the $\text{SEI}$ stabilization to a $\text{LiF}$-dominated composition. Crucially, $\text{cryogenic atom probe tomography (APT)}$ revealed spatially distinct nanoscale compositional regimes within the alloy, rationalizing the solid solution reaction mechanism governed by kinetic limitations.

- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To introduce and experimentally image synthetic spatiotemporal plasmonic vortices ($\text{STPVs}$) carrying nontrivial topological spin textures generated by chronotopic interference.
- **Finding**: $\text{STPVs}$ were generated by chronotopic interference, where a $\pi$-phase dislocation in the space-frequency domain maps into a $2\pi$ spiraling phase in space-time. $\text{Interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM)}$ was used to directly image their nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution and control the vortex number and position, establishing $\text{STPVs}$ as a platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter.

- **Objective**: To investigate the modulation of superconducting vortex bound states by the unidirectional charge density wave ($\text{CDW}$) in the transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor $1\text{T}''\text{-NbTe}_2$.
- **Finding**: Using $\text{ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS)}$, researchers observed elliptical vortices whose elongation aligned with the stripe-like $3\times 1\times 3$ $\text{CDW}$ order, demonstrating strong coupling.

- **Objective**: To propose an analytical physical model explaining secondary electron ($\text{SE}$) topographical contrast formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy ($\text{STEM}$) by accounting for the interaction of emitted $\text{SEs}$ with the objective lens magnetic field.
- **Finding**: An analytical physical model was developed that accurately incorporates the physics of $\text{SE}$ emission and their complex interaction with the magnetic field within the $\text{TEM}$ objective lens. This model enables more reliable image interpretation of $\text{SE}$ contrast in $\text{STEM}$ and provides the foundation for future $3\text{D}$ surface reconstruction algorithms.

- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in anisotropic $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{N}$ thin films and correlate them with structural and magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: Tetragonal samples ($\text{x}=0.8$ and $1$) exhibited unusual two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects hysteresis loops. $\text{Electron microscopy}$ confirmed the co-existence of two crystallographic orientations (c-axis and a-axis normal to the film surface). $\text{DFT}$ calculations revealed that the two-component behavior results from the opposite sign of the anomalous effects for magnetization along the a and c-axes, combined with magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

- **Objective**: To investigate how the miscut angle of c-plane sapphire substrates influences the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting transition temperature ($\text{T}_c$) of $\text{MBE}$-grown $\text{NbN}$ films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle from $0.5^\text{o}$ to $10^\text{o}$ significantly improved the structural quality of the $\text{NbN}$ films, reducing the $\text{XRD}$ rocking curve $\text{FWHM}$ from $76$ to $20\ \text{arcsecs}$. $\text{Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)}$ images determined that the critical thickness for the onset of columnar growth is consistently around $10\ \text{nm}$, irrespective of the miscut angle, correlating the structural improvement with a marginal increase in $\text{T}_c$ from $12.1\ \text{K}$ to $12.5\ \text{K}$.

**26. [Mechanistic Transition from Screw to Edge Dislocation Glide Enhances High-Temperature Strength in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10869v1)**
- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism driving the transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, which enhances high-temperature strength in refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs).
- **Finding**: Increasing the V content in the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system induces substantial atomic misfit, which preferentially raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was integrated with mechanical testing and simulations to reveal this underlying mechanistic transition.
