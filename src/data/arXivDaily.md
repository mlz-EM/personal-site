**3. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part II - COMSOL Simulation and Apparatus Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03821v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the mechanism of irregular crystallization in ZBLAN glass under vibration-assisted heat treatments, attributed to intermittent thermal contact, through finite element modeling and experimental validation.

**4. [Single photon emitters in hBN: Limitations of atomic resolution imaging and potential sources of error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03674v1)**
- **Authors**: David Lamprecht, Shrirang Chokappa, Alissa M. Freilinger, Barbara Maria Mayer, Maximilian Melchior, Jana Dzíbelová, Darwin Lorber, Luiz H. G. Tizei, Mathieu Kociak, Clemens Mangler, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the limitations of annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) for identifying single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) at atomic resolution, especially in thicker flakes, and identify potential sources of error.
- **Finding**: *STEM image simulations and experiments* demonstrated that, even under idealized conditions, intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable in hBN flakes thicker than 17 atomic layers (ca. 6 nm). Vacancy-type defects also become unreliable to detect at thicknesses typically used in photonic studies. The study further showed that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial contrast differences, potentially resulting in misidentification of atomic defects in *atomic-resolution STEM*.

- **Objective**: Introduce Optical Near-field Electron Microscopy (ONEM), a novel method for super-resolution, non-invasive, label-free imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution, applicable to bio- and materials science.
- **Finding**: ONEM converts optical near-field intensity patterns into photoelectron emission, enabling nanometer-scale imaging using low-energy *electron microscopy*. It achieves 31 nm spatial and sub-second temporal resolution without exposing the sample to electrons, preserving structural and functional integrity. ONEM was demonstrated by imaging polarization-dependent plasmon modes in metal nanostructures, visualizing live *Escherichia coli* in liquid with orientation-resolved contrast in 3D, and capturing real-time electrodeposition of copper nanoclusters from solution, establishing it as a versatile platform for damage-free super-resolution imaging of interface dynamics.

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the nano-scale structural peculiarities of the antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and explain their role in its puzzling magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: *High-resolution transmission electron microscopy* revealed the presence of planar defects in the EuSn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ lattice. A combination of *microstructural and DFT analysis* demonstrated that these single planar nano-defects form a layer of a distinct EuSnAs$_{2}$ phase, different from the bulk EuSn$_{2}$As$_{2}$. The smaller distance between Eu layers within these defects promotes local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of Eu atoms, leading to a weak ferromagnetic phase within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice, which explains the non-linear magnetization in low in-plane fields, ferromagnetic-type hysteresis, and the upturn of magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures.

- **Finding**: A novel dropcasting procedure was developed to isolate individual MCFs onto *TEM*-compatible substrates, enabling nanoscale visualization of the arrangement of organic and mineral phases. A *4D-STEM approach* was used to examine the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs. Furthermore, *first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments* revealed exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and mechanical behavior. *TEM capabilities* resolved MCF organization and composition down to the nanoscale, opening new avenues for bio-inspired material design.

- **Objective**: Develop a metrological approach using electron ptychography to achieve atomic-scale precision in mapping the topography of free surfaces and buried interfaces within ultrathin freestanding oxide heterostructures, addressing limitations caused by surface roughness and interfacial imperfections.
- **Finding**: A metrological approach leveraging three-dimensional structures reconstructed from *multislice electron ptychography* was developed, achieving atomic-scale precision in mapping the topography of both free surfaces and buried interfaces. This method also allows for counting atoms, including light elements such as oxygen, along the electron trajectory in *electron microscopy*, leading to the identification of surface termination in oxide films. The planar-view geometry provides rich information and high statistics about atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities, offering unprecedented capabilities for correlating structural imperfection with quantum device performance.

- **Objective**: Quantify the full damage profile, including the often-overlooked lateral spread, of focused ion beams (FIBs) using 4D-STEM precession electron diffraction and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics.
- **Finding**: *Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)* was employed to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. *Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED)* patterns collected in calibration regions and around static dwell spots exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam were compared. Cross-correlation using PSNR revealed that *4D-STEM datasets* are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artifacts than conventional dark-field imaging, providing a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes.

- **Authors**: Vivek Devulapalli, Fedor F. Klimashin, Manuel Bärtschi, Stephan Waldner, Silvia Schwyn Thöny, Johann Michler, Xavier Maeder
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: Examine the nanoindentation hardness and deformation behavior of amorphous-amorphous Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$/SiO$_{2}$ nanolaminates with varying bilayer thicknesses to understand the role of interfaces in their mechanical response.
- **Finding**: Hardness decreased with reduced bilayer thickness, from 7.7 GPa at 334 nm to 5.5 GPa at 2 nm spacing, contrasting with crystalline systems that strengthen with decreasing spacing. *Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy* revealed that fine bilayer spacings promoted closely spaced vertical shear bands with bilayer compression, while coarser spacings showed fewer, widely spaced shear bands with chemical intermixing. *Scanning electron diffraction mapping* demonstrated significant densification beneath indents. The high interface density facilitated strain accommodation, preventing catastrophic failure typical of brittle amorphous materials.

- **Authors**: Volodymyr Vasylkovskyi, Andrey Evlyukhin, Elena Schlein, Mykola Slipchenko, Roman Kiyan, Kestutis Kurselis, Vladimir Dyakonov, Boris Chichkov
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: Develop a novel, ligand-free approach using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in ambient air to synthesize high-purity organic-inorganic and all-inorganic lead-free double perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with tunable properties.
- **Finding**: The novel PLA method successfully synthesized MAPbX$_{3}$ and Cs$_{2}$AgBiX$_{6}$ NCs without stabilizing ligands, a critical advancement over conventional chemical synthesis. *Transmission electron microscopy* and X-ray diffraction confirmed the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX$_{3}$ forming larger (approximately 90 nm) cubic NCs and Cs$_{2}$AgBiX$_{6}$ forming smaller (approximately 10 nm) rounded NCs. Photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed pronounced size-dependent blue shifts (17-40 nm) due to quantum confinement, particularly for Br and I containing perovskites.

- **Authors**: Xiliang Yang, Tetsuo Martynowicz, Allard Katan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Sabina Caneva
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Objective**: Demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can act as self-assembled nanochannels for biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy.
- **Finding**: Scalable and reproducible hBN wrinkle networks were created by controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties. Structural characterization using *atomic force and scanning electron microscopy* was complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained within the nanochannels. Selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging were achieved in these one-dimensional channels through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure, where the graphene overlayer suppressed background fluorescence, providing a scalable, lithography-free route for planar nanofluidic confinements compatible with single-molecule imaging.

- **Authors**: Juheon Lee, Yeon Wook Kim, Hwanseok Chang, Herve Hugonnet, Seung-Mo Hong, Seokwoo Jeon, YongKeun Park
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Objective**: Introduce incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT), a non-interferometric optical imaging method, to quantitatively reconstruct the 3D dielectric tensor and measure biaxial anisotropy with submicron resolution.
- **Finding**: Incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT) was introduced as a non-interferometric optical imaging method that quantitatively reconstructs the 3D dielectric tensor under incoherent, polarization-diverse illumination. By combining polarization diversity and angular-spectrum modulation, iDTT achieved speckle-free and vibration-robust mapping of biaxial birefringence with submicron resolution. Simulations and experiments validated its quantitative accuracy, and when applied to mixed and polycrystalline materials, iDTT distinguished crystal types by their birefringent properties and revealed 3D grain orientations and boundaries, establishing it as a practical and accessible tool for quantitative, label-free characterization of biaxial anisotropy.

**15. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part I -- Experimental Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25748v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley, Ujjwal Dhakal
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Objective**: Systematically investigate the influence of mechanical vibration on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN glass using a controlled heating and vibration apparatus.
- **Finding**: Vibration reduced the crystallization onset temperature, indicating enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. *Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM)* were used to examine crystallization onset and morphological evolution. Surface roughness analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale roughness in crystallized regions, confirming that vibration directly facilitates nucleation rather than acting as a purely thermal effect.

- **Authors**: Antonin Louiset, Daniel Förster, Vincent Jourdain, Saïd Tahir, Nicola Vigano, Jean-Luc Rouvière, Christophe Bichara, Hanako Okuno
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in the structural analysis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), including chirality determination, strain mapping, and atomic defect imaging.
- **Finding**: *Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)*, utilizing fast pixelated electron detectors, allowed for rapid acquisition of low-noise electron diffraction patterns. This data enabled precise determination of local chirality for multiple nanotubes simultaneously with limited electron dose (down to 1750 e$^{-}$/{\AA}$^{2}$) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). The approach also allowed tracking chirality along a single nanotube and mapping strain distribution. Furthermore, *4D-STEM data* enabled reconstruction of high-resolution images with *electron ptychography*, achieving atomic-scale spatial resolution for atomic defect imaging, with *multi-slice electron ptychography* offering potential for near-3D atomic-resolution imaging of nanotube defect structures.

**17. [Optimizing probes for multi-beam ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24542v1)**
- **Authors**: Runqing Yang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez, Maik Kahnt
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: Establish a quantitative framework for assessing and designing structured probes to optimize multi-beam ptychography (MBP) reconstructions, making them more robust and scalable.
- **Finding**: A quantitative framework was developed to assess probe sets based on separability, uniformity, and fabrication feasibility for multi-beam ptychography (MBP). The study showed that Hadamard-based binary phase masks consistently outperform Zernike polynomials, experimentally feasible phase plates, and spiral phase masks across varying scan densities. While spiral masks yielded comparable resolution, they scaled less efficiently due to increased structural complexity. These results establish practical criteria for evaluating and designing structured probes to enable more robust and scalable implementation of MBP in high-throughput coherent X-ray and EUV imaging.

**18. [Noise Estimation and Suppression in Quantitative EMCD Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24445v1)**
- **Authors**: Hitoshi Makino, Bernd Rellinghaus, Sebastian Schneider, Axel Lubk, Darius Pohl
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: Present a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) measurements, which is crucial for its practical application in transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: A comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in *EMCD measurements* was demonstrated on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was systematically analyzed using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure minimized systematic errors, and variance-to-mean analysis revealed that detector-amplified shot noise, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras, is the dominant noise source. The work recommends stricter SNR thresholds for reliable EMCD detection and quantification, providing a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary for valid measurements and advancing the reliability of EMCD as a quantitative nanoscale magnetic characterization tool in *TEM*.

- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: Demonstrate a new approach for lensless 3D imaging of non-periodic, stationary objects using X-ray fluorescence intensity correlations, without requiring extensive sample rotation.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that intensity correlations of X-ray fluorescence excited by ultrashort X-ray pulses contain 3D structural information of non-periodic, stationary objects. By illuminating a vanadium foil within a sub-200 nm X-ray laser beam focus and recording 16 distinct specimen projections from different detector regions (covering varying photon incidence angles), systematic variations were observed as the fluorescing volume was translated. This confirmed that FEL-induced fluorescence reflects real-space structural changes, establishing a novel lensless 3D imaging method for non-periodic specimens, with broad implications for materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology, complementing conventional *electron microscopy*.

**20. [Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moirés](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042v1)**
- **Authors**: Harikrishnan KP, Xin Wei, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Ruijuan Xu, Jong-Hoon Kang, Ce Liang, Jiwoong Park, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Objective**: Investigate the challenges of achieving atomic-level coupling at buried interfaces in twisted oxide moirés, particularly focusing on topographic mismatch due to surface roughness, and evaluate characterization methods.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of membranes restricts atomic-scale proximity at interfaces to isolated patches, even after eliminating contaminants. In hybrid interfaces, the reduced ability of 2D materials to conform to membrane topography also limits atomic-scale contact. *Cross-sectional imaging* was found to be essential for characterizing interface morphology. Critically, conventional through-focal imaging in projection was relatively insensitive to buried interfaces, whereas *electron ptychography* reliably resolved structural variations on the order of a nanometer, highlighting the need for advanced *electron microscopy* characterization methods like ptychography for oxide twistronics.

**21. [Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320v1)**
- **Authors**: Tim Titze, Sabri Koraltan, Timo Schmidt, Mailin Matthies, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Dieter Suess, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil
- **Date**: 2025-10-24
- **Objective**: Investigate the control of bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers through stripe domain engineering.
- **Finding**: Ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers host maze-like stripe domains that transform into a disordered bubble/skyrmion lattice under out-of-plane magnetic fields. Applying a brief in-plane "set" magnetic field to the stripe state enhanced both the frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. *Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)*, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations revealed that this enhancement resulted from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. This demonstrates precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics and potentially topology by modifying the initial domain configuration.

It supports advanced experimental parameter corrections such as orthogonal probe relaxation and multislice modeling. Leveraging PyTorch, it ensures vendor-agnostic GPU acceleration, multi-device parallelization, and access to modern optimizers. Its object-oriented, modular design makes it highly extendable, enabling researchers to prototype new imaging models or integrate machine learning approaches, and was demonstrated through challenging case studies highlighting its accuracy, versatility, and extensibility for advancing computational ptychography, including *electron ptychography*.

Partially coated CR-39 pieces were exposed to AmBe, $^{252}$Cf, and D-T (14 MeV) neutron sources. The detection efficiency (tracks per neutron) was evaluated for each source spectrum using *optical microscope and large-area Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging* over the irradiated area, both with and without the BN coating, providing a comprehensive guide to neutron detection with various sources using CR-39.

- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: Systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) analysis, particularly its spatial resolution and accuracy, by applying it to the metamagnetic phase transition in FeRh.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated the applicability of *electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD)* to a correlated material (FeRh) exhibiting coupled structural and magnetic order. It confirmed that the extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remained consistent with XMCD benchmarks for *transmission electron microscopy (TEM)* probes down to approximately 6 nm, establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$ was observed, attributed to instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity. This confirms EMCD's quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments inaccessible to photon-based methods.

**25. [Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517v2)**
- **Authors**: M. J. Adriaans, J. P. Hoogenboom, A. Mohammadi-Gheidari
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: Analyze the design considerations for electrostatic electron monochromators, identify limitations of current designs, and propose a cost-effective, simpler design based on pure fringe fields for enhancing spatial and energy resolution in electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: A thin-deflector analysis of electrostatic homogeneous-field deflectors revealed their extreme sensitivity to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections. The study demonstrated that fringe-field deflectors are less sensitive to these issues. A cost-effective and simple monochromator design based on pure fringe fields was proposed, which does not require extra correcting elements and achieves optimal energy resolution by including momentary deceleration lenses surrounding the main deflector. This fully electrostatic design could be realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies in *scanning electron microscopes*.

- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To develop a novel approach for predicting the 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell anodes from more accessible 2D SEM images, overcoming the limitations of costly 3D acquisition methods.
- **Finding**: The proposed method utilizes a low-parametric 3D stochastic geometry model to generate virtual 3D microstructures and employs a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain corresponding 2D SEM images. By systematically varying model parameters, a large dataset is generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling the statistical reconstruction of 3D microstructures from 2D SEM images. An error analysis on key geometrical descriptors quantitatively evaluated the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool, demonstrating its potential for cost-effective 3D microstructure characterization.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to directly resolve the induced heterostrain, lattice deformations, and stacking variations that produced the moiré superlattice. They found that uniaxial and biaxial heterostrain resulted in distinct moiré patterns (stripes and distorted hexagonal patterns) and created in-plane polar distortions at the domain boundaries of the MoS$_2$ moiré superlattice. This deterministic and scalable approach opens new avenues for designing moiré geometries in 2D materials.
