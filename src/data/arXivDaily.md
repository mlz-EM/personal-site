- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To revisit contrast transfer mechanisms in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to understand where information is encoded and identify new imaging modes, including fast approximations to ptychography.
- **Finding**: The study shows that tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) in **4D-STEM** enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximally utilizes 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond WPOA, information from inelastic/plural scattering is identified, and a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) is demonstrated, promising for depth sectioning of strong scatterers, generalizing phase contrast theory to 4D-STEM.

**5. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware metric for assessing phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), addressing the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that the CTF overestimates practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes, by neglecting finite electron fluence. SSNR, a dose-aware statistical framework, was employed to evaluate the recoverable signal in **STEM** phase retrieval methods. Numerical reconstructions showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, while iterative ptychography shows a dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds.

These walls, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, adopt distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-$nm^2$ footprint, representing one of the smallest domains reported in any polar material.

- **Objective**: To observe and understand the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions.
- **Finding**: Using the high structural and magnetic resolution of **in situ transmission electron microscopy**, the study observed that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, switching it from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This led to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned by underlying dislocation networks, which were formed and rearranged upon repeated phase transition crossings.

- **Finding**: The study developed an inverse modeling formalism for DFXM, demonstrating that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible using oblique diffraction geometry. A computational framework was also developed for forward calculation of anticipated angular shifts and reconstruction of average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for individual pixels. Sensitivity analysis methods were presented to relate tensor components to DFXM angles and compute associated errors, highlighting DFXM's advantage over techniques like transmission electron microscopy for bulk materials.

Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction revealed an achiral-to-chiral phase transition originating from cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms. A spatially varying piezoelectric response was observed, and an external electric-strain-field coupling was proposed as a conjugate field for switching chirality.

- **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanisms of undesired ablation during femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation of copper (Cu) nanoparticles relevant to sintering applications.
- **Finding**: Particle size distributions extracted from **scanning electron microscopy** revealed a bimodal transformation of Cu nanoparticles under fs laser scanning: emergence of sub-60 nm debris and formation of large aggregates up to 750 nm. Analysis ruled out Coulomb explosion and identified hot electron blast as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and blast pressures above 4 GPa. This work highlights that fs laser-induced ablation in Cu nanoparticles is driven predominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics.

- **Finding**: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms in GdZn$_3$P$_3$. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy** demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting ZnP bond instability. Magnetic measurements confirmed long-range A-type antiferromagnetic order at $T_N = 4.5$ K with strong magnetic anisotropy. The system exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at $T_N$, likely associated with the observed interstitial P atoms, establishing GdZn$_3$P$_3$ as a system to study charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism coupling.

NWs with larger crystalline domains allowed homogeneous Bi incorporation, while smaller domains showed Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. Thermal stability studies showed lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice upon heating.

**27. [Mass-transport-limited reaction rates and molecular diffusion in the van der Waals gap beneath graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07479v1)**
- **Authors**: Hossein Mirdamadi, Jiří David, Rui Wang, Tianle Jiang, Yanming Wang, Karel Vařeka, Michal Dymáček, Petr Bábor, Tomáš Šikola, Miroslav Kolíbal
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To identify the kinetic limitations of confined reactions within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between a two-dimensional material and a catalytic substrate.
- **Finding**: Using in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the study found that graphene etching reaction rates in the vdW gap by various molecules (O$_{2}$, H$_{2}$, and CO) are limited by mass transport within the confined space. SEM allowed for direct observation of the etching dynamics, revealing that this limitation persists even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport due to a significant lifting of the vdW gap, suggesting the vdW gap acts as an effective nanoreactor once mass-transport limitations are overcome.

**29. [Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06756v1)**
- **Authors**: Tamazouzt Chennit, Songge Li, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Christoph Hofer, Nadine J. Schrenker, Liberato Manna, Sara Bals, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
- **Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Objective**: To investigate the convergence properties of iterative electron ptychography methods, especially under low electron doses ($<$ 10$^{3}$ $e^-/A^2$), and the impact of user-defined update strengths.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that carefully chosen, relatively small update strengths for both the object and probe are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential in low-dose ptychography. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, it was shown that convergence is practically achievable only when these update strengths are small, highlighting the critical need for optimized reconstruction parameters to ensure both effective convergence and correctness of the result.

- **Authors**: Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Yung-Chang Lin, Kazu Suenaga
- **Date**: 2025-07-08
- **Objective**: To review recent progress in using free-standing bilayer graphene (BLG) as a template for the intercalation and synthesis of novel 2D materials.

This atomic-scale dynamic observation by operando TEM provides unprecedented mechanistic insight into the spatial separation and intrinsic coupling of redox reactions through dynamic interface migration.

**41. [Light-induced Pairing Instability of Ultrafast Electron Beams with Space Charge Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00869v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Geng, Qiaofei Pan, Jian Kang, Yiming Pan
- **Date**: 2025-07-01
