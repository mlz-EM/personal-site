- **Authors**: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas Müller, Andreas Bezold, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Objective**: Introduce a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method to enable full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals, overcoming the limitation of edge-on configurations.

**15. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: Explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and identify approaches to optimize its $Z$-sensitivity for improved element distinguishability.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that ptychography's $Z$-dependence is highly sensitive to the integrated area of an atom column, showing a monotonic $Z$-dependence for small integration areas but becoming highly non-monotonic and following orbital shell-structure trends for larger areas. This non-monotonic $Z$-dependence was shown to be useful for accentuating contrast between elements differing by only one atomic number (e.g., $\beta$-CuZn) even in thick samples, demonstrating how atom column integration area can optimize $Z$-contrast for specific applications and experimental conditions.

-   **Authors**: Sharmistha Dey, Nahid Chaudhary, Ulrich Kentsch, Rajendra Singh, Pankaj Srivastava, Santanu Ghosh
-   **Date**: 2025-05-27
-   **Objective**: To thoroughly investigate the alterations in magnetic properties and electronic structure of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown nano-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_{2}$) after low-energy ion irradiation, aiming to induce robust room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM).
-   **Finding**: **Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM)** images confirmed triangular flake formation in pristine samples, which fragmented into smaller ones with increasing irradiation fluences, enhancing the number of edge-terminated structures. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction identified the pure hexagonal 2-H phase. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the formation of S-vacancies after irradiation. The study demonstrated that while pristine MoS$_{2}$ was diamagnetic, ion irradiation induced RTFM, with the saturation magnetization increasing with fluence, attributing the RTFM to edge-terminated structures and point defects like S-vacancies.

-   **Date**: 2025-05-25
-   **Objective**: To study the structural, magnetic, and acoustic characteristics of nanometric Pt/Co superlattices, exploring their potential for THz nanoacoustic devices.
-   **Finding**: X-ray reflectometry confirmed a well-defined periodicity in the samples. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** with local compositional analysis revealed that the superlattices presented a modulation in composition rather than sharp interfaces. The polycrystalline nature was evidenced by both X-ray diffraction and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)**. Magnetization measurements showed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for higher Co concentrations. Picosecond acoustic experiments demonstrated that the studied samples support short-lived acoustic modes up to 900 GHz, and up to 7 acoustic echoes at lower frequencies, indicating promising results for ultrahigh-frequency magnetoacoustic devices.

-   **Date**: 2025-05-23
-   **Objective**: To introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle-consistent generative adversarial system capable of generating realistic synthetic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps, addressing the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets in nanomaterial research.
-   **Finding**: The F-ANcGAN model, which utilizes a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention, successfully generated realistic **scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** images of nanoparticles. The architecture achieved a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_{2}$ dataset generation, which was further reduced to nearly 10.39 using efficient post-processing techniques. This approach facilitates scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, which can significantly improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis.

-   **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Vanessa S. Antonin, Caio Machado Fernandes, Liying Liu, Mauro C. Santos
-   **Date**: 2025-05-22
-   **Objective**: To investigate the improvement of H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ electrogeneration via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb$_{2}$O$_{5}$.
-   **Finding**: **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** were used for the characterization of the Ce-doped Nb$_{2}$O$_{5}$ electrocatalysts. The Nb$_{2}$O$_{5}$ doped with 0.5% Ce showed the highest electrocatalytic response, producing 105% and 86% more H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ at applied potentials of -1.3 V and -1.9 V, respectively, compared to the un-doped counterpart. This enhanced performance was attributed to the Ce doping inducing local distortions in the crystal lattice of Nb$_{2}$O$_{5}$ and increasing hydrophilicity, which facilitated electron transfer and O$_{2}$ transport, favoring the ORR.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the atomic topology and magnetic microstructure of individual, highly mobile Type I and Type II twin boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga martensite using transmission electron microscopy.
-   **Finding**: **High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)** confirmed an atomically sharp Type I twin boundary oriented along the rational (101) plane and an atomically sharp Type II boundary, contrasting previous suggestions of its diffuse nature, apart from occasional single-atomic-plane steps. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** showed 180° domain walls within martensite variants. The magnetic induction reoriented sharply on both twin boundaries, forming 90°-like magnetic domain walls that followed the c-axis easy-magnetization direction.

**40. [Revealing Information from Weak Signal in Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy with a Deep Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14032v1)**
-   **Authors**: Yifan Wang, Mai Tan, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Peter A. Crozier
-   **Date**: 2025-05-20
-   **Objective**: To develop and demonstrate a deep denoiser, the unsupervised deep video denoiser (UDVD), for revealing information from weak signals in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) datasets acquired with direct electron detectors.
-   **Finding**: The UDVD, a CNN-based denoiser, was developed and adapted for energy-loss spectral series. The study identified and proposed adjustments to suppress artifacts associated with the charge spreading effect at pixel interfaces on direct electron detectors. They demonstrated the denoiser's effectiveness using two challenging real data examples: mapping Gd dopants in CeO$_{2}$ nanoparticles and characterizing vibrational modes in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with atomic resolution using **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-EELS**, showcasing its ability to reveal information from weak signals.

**41. [Unifying Strain-driven and Pressure-driven Superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: Suppressed charge/spin density waves and enhanced interlayer coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12733v1)**
-   **Authors**: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
-   **Date**: 2025-05-19
-   **Objective**: To elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ by comprehensively analyzing its structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics using density functional theory calculations.
-   **Finding**: Consistent with recent **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** observations, the study found an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. Compressive strain lowered Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels, while interfacial Sr diffusion effectively reconstructed the $d_{z^2}$ pockets. The interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_{\perp}$ closely tracked experimental superconducting $T_{c}$ variation. Compressive strain suppressed both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities, analogous to pressure effects, indicating that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_{\perp}$ are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity.

-   **Authors**: Bo Hao, Maosen Wang, Wenjie Sun, Yang Yang, Zhangwen Mao, Shengjun Yan, Haoying Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Lu Han, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dianxiang Ji, Yuefeng Nie
-   **Date**: 2025-05-19
-   **Objective**: To report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films and explore their phase diagram, which is critical for advancing the field of nickelate superconductivity.
-   **Finding**: The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) followed an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) with an optimal $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$42 K at $x = 0.09$. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** revealed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupied planar NiO$_{2}$ sites, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples, due to Coulomb repulsion under compressive strain. Additionally, elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples, likely weakened the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films and establishing Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity.

-   **Authors**: Jongwoo Ha, Minah Choi, Jieun Yang, Chinkyo Kim
-   **Date**: 2025-05-16
-   **Objective**: To demonstrate a scalable thru-hole epitaxy (THE) method for achieving localized, defect-suppressed GaN growth through self-adjusting hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) masks derived from solution-processed 2D stacks.
-   **Finding**: The disordered $h$-BN mask exhibited a self-adjusting structure during growth, allowing percolative precursor transport and coherent GaN nucleation beneath otherwise blocking layers. Comprehensive structural analyses using **scanning electron microscopy (SEM)**, Raman mapping, and **high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)** confirmed both the presence of epitaxial GaN beneath the $h$-BN and the suppression of threading dislocations. This strategy eliminates the need for patterned 2D mask transfers, demonstrating a scalable route to selective-area GaN growth on arbitrary substrates relevant to future micro-LED and photonic integration platforms.

-   **Date**: 2025-05-16
-   **Objective**: To reveal and characterize the presence of a previously unreported polar phase of WO$_{3}$ obtained in thin films grown on YAlO$_{3}$ substrates, stabilized by epitaxial strain.
-   **Finding**: Epitaxial strain stabilized a triclinic phase of WO$_{3}$, whose unit cell was fully determined by large-scale reciprocal space mapping. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** observations revealed strain gradients around domain walls and local variations of octahedral tilts, which could explain the stabilization of the triclinic phase up to unexpectedly large film thicknesses. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) maps showed an in-plane striped domain pattern with needle-like bifurcations, evidencing the polar nature of the films, and local modulations of conductivity were shown by conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) and **scanning electron microscopy (SEM)**.

-   **Objective**: To achieve atomic-scale control over structural modulations in quasi-1D chalcogenides (Sr$_{x}$TiS$_{3}$) to further enhance their colossal optical anisotropy, guided by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
-   **Finding**: DFT calculations predicted an indirect-to-direct band gap transition and increased occupancy of Ti-$d_{z^2}$ states for $x$ equal to and larger than 1.143, leading to a theoretically predicted maximum birefringence of 2.5 for Sr$_{1.143}$TiS$_{3}$. Single crystals of Sr$_{1.143}$TiS$_{3}$ were grown using a molten-salt flux method. **Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** confirmed the feasibility of synthesizing Sr$_{x}$TiS$_{3}$ with varied modulation periodicities, demonstrating compositional tunability of optical properties in these compounds by controlling structural modulations.

-   **Authors**: Songge Li, Nicolas Gauquelin, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Arno Annys, Chuang Gao, Christoph Hofer, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
-   **Date**: 2025-05-14
-   **Objective**: To propose and validate strategies for improving the accuracy and robustness of aberration correction in single sideband (SSB) electron ptychography under low-dose conditions, addressing its sensitivity to noise.
-   **Finding**: The authors proposed two strategies: confining phase unwrapping within the sidebands and selecting only well-unwrapped sidebands for calculating aberration coefficients. These strategies were validated through SSB reconstructions of both simulated and experimental 4D-STEM datasets of monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_{2}$). A comparison of results demonstrated significant improvements in Poisson noise tolerance, making aberration correction more robust and reliable for low-dose **electron ptychography** imaging.

-   **Authors**: Moha Naeimi, Katharina Engster, Waqas Pervez, Ingo Barke, Sylvia Speller
-   **Date**: 2025-05-14
-   **Objective**: To image domain boundaries of rubrene thin crystallites and explore the interplay between photoemission processes, crystal morphology, and defect states using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopy.
-   **Finding**: In a 2-photon photoemission (2PPE) process, **PEEM images** revealed dominant emission localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states. In contrast, in 1PPE nm excitation, uniform emission across the crystal surface was observed, highlighting a fundamental difference in photoemission mechanisms. Furthermore, in the intermediate photon energy range, a nonlinear, non-integer photon order was identified, where mostly the triclinic morphology contributed to the emission, distinguishing it from the orthorhombic phase. These findings provide a new framework for assessing the quality and internal structure of organic semiconductor thin films via wavelength-dependent photoemission imaging and spectroscopy.

-   **Date**: 2025-05-13
-   **Objective**: To examine the structure and migration of twin boundaries in tetragonal $\beta$-Sn, comparing experimental observations with direct atomistic simulations using machine learning-based interatomic potentials.
-   **Finding**: **High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)** images of deformation twins in $\beta$-Sn were compared to the results of direct atomistic simulations. Machine learning-based potentials developed in this work were found to give results consistent with experimental data, revealing faceted twin boundary structures formed by the nucleation and motion of twinning disconnections. Bicrystallographic methods combined with atomistic simulations identified low-energy asymmetric Prismatic-A-plane (PA/AP) interfaces, analogous to Prismatic-Basal (PB/BP) interfaces in HCP metals, which are important for twin growth in $\beta$-Sn.

-   **Finding**: The study focused on restoring images by extracting unwanted signal components or denoising them using TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ models. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible, while TGV-$L^1$ was most suitable for denoising. The workflow was successfully applied to images obtained from various microscopy techniques, including **atomic force microscopy (AFM)**, **scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)**, and **scanning electron microscopy (SEM)**, suggesting a wider applicability for improving image quality and revealing relevant features in microscopy.

-   **Finding**: PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters (e.g., sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, mixed probe and object modes) using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation. By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieved up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. The framework also proposes a real-space depth regularization to avoid wrap-around artifacts and integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow for hyperparameter selection, fostering reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in **electron ptychography**.
