**1. [Probing Boundary Spins in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17173v1)**
- **Authors**: Armando A. Aligia, Alejandro M. Lobos, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Claudio J. Gazza
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Objective**: To propose an experimental approach using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR) to detect localized spins near the ends of a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain.
- **Finding**: The study proposes that when the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, resulting in a low-bias Kondo peak. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides a clear, indirect signature of these localized boundary spins.

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the limitations and potential sources of error when using Annular Dark-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (ADF-STEM) to identify atomic defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To study the nano-scale structural peculiarities of the antiferromagnetic layered semimetal $\text{EuSn}_{2}\text{As}_{2}$ and explain its puzzling magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) revealed the presence of planar defects, which were identified as single layers of a distinct $\text{EuSnAs}_{2}$ phase. This nano-defect phase promotes local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Eu atoms due to a smaller inter-layer distance, resulting in a weak ferromagnetic phase within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice, which explains the nonlinear magnetization and low-field hysteresis observed experimentally.
