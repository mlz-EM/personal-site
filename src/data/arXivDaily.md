**1. [Thermal Control of Size Distribution and Optical Properties in Gallium Nanoparticles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17658v1)**
- **Authors**: S. Catalan-Gomez, M. Ibanez, J. Rico, V. Braza, D. F. Reyes, E. Squiccimarro, J. M. Ulloa
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the effect of substrate temperature on the nucleation, growth, size distribution, and optical properties of Gallium Nanoparticles (Ga-NPs) thermally evaporated on GaAs.
- **Finding**: An optimal temperature window ($300-350^\circ\text{C}$) yields narrowly dispersed, dense Ga-NP arrays. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to analyze size dispersion and morphology, showing that higher temperatures lead to larger, sparser, and flattened NPs due to enhanced diffusion and Ostwald ripening. Cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed a core-shell architecture, quantified temperature-driven oxide thickening, and verified the liquid-metal nature of the Ga NP core.

- **Authors**: Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Arno Annys, Tamazouzt Chennit, Jo Verbeeck
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To establish a new, quantization-based methodological framework, "guided progressive reconstructive imaging," for ptychography to enable low-dose, high-throughput, and real-time phase retrieval.
- **Finding**: The framework adapts direct phase retrieval solutions for continuous treatment of received counts, resulting in a progressively improving estimate with processing speeds that can surpass the acquisition bandwidth. This methodology, enabled by a pre-calculated library of kernel-limited guide functions, offers high dose-efficiency and flexibility, and is applicable to electron-based imaging (a core EM modality), X-ray diffraction, and optical microscopy.

- **Authors**: P. Shvets, G. Kirichuk, V. Salnikov, J. O'Connell, V. Rodionova, A. Goikhman, K. Maksimova
- **Date**: 2025-12-19

**4. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Ptsingle bondRu overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v1)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of varying $\text{Pt}/\text{Ru}$ ratios in electrodeposited overlays on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of $\text{NiCoCrAlYTa}$ coatings.
- **Finding**: Higher Pt contents led to superior oxidation resistance, attributed to the formation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina ($\alpha-\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO). Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDS) confirmed these microstructural differences, showing that increased Ru contents, conversely, led to the development of microcracks and less protective oxides within the TGO layer.

- **Authors**: Philipp M. Wolf, Eduardo Pitthan, Zhen Zhang, Tuan T. Tran, Radek Holeňák, Daniel Primetzhofer
- **Date**: 2025-12-18
- **Objective**: To examine the formation and epitaxy of ultrathin $\text{Ti}$-silicide on $\text{Si}(100)$ using a combination of non-destructive ion scattering techniques.
- **Finding**: While ion scattering indicated intermixing and ordering, High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) images confirmed the formation of a $\approx 1.5 \text{ nm}$ thick epitaxial silicide layer at the interface, which is crucial for minimizing contact resistivity. HR-TEM also unveiled significant variations in silicide layer thickness and substantial interface roughness, which did not propagate to the surface.

- **Finding**: An in-house Phase-Field modeling framework successfully simulated the nanostructural evolution. The model predictions were validated against available electron microscopy imaging data, demonstrating a detailed comprehension of crystal nucleation and growth shaped by amorphous spinodal decomposition, thereby providing valuable insights for physically-based morphology control in organic electronics.

**11. [Visualizing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of GaN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15989v1)**
- **Authors**: Abby Liu, Zhucong Xi, Xiaobo Chen, Catherine Huang, Meng Li, Judith C. Yang, Liang Qi, Dmitri N. Zakharov, Rachel S. Goldman
- **Date**: 2025-12-17
- **Objective**: To elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms governing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of Gallium Nitride ($\text{GaN}$) from $\text{Ga}$ droplet arrays using real-time observation.
- **Finding**: Real-time environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) was used to visualize the distinct processes. E-TEM revealed that at intermediate to high temperatures, $\text{GaN}$ nucleation and growth occur from $\text{Ga}$ droplets, with growth preferentially occurring at pre-existing $\text{GaN}$ nuclei due to epitaxial templating and reduced Gibbs free energy for $\text{NH}_3$ decomposition at the $\text{Ga}/\text{GaN}$ interface.

- **Authors**: N. V. Porokhov, M. A. Dryazgov, A. R. Shevchenko, A. M. Mumlyakov, Z. S. Enbaev, Yu. V. Blinova, D. I. Devyaterikov, Yu. P. Korneeva, A. A. Korneev, M. A. Tarkhov
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the effect of a Scandium Nitride ($\text{ScN}$) buffer layer on the superconducting properties of thin Niobium Nitride ($\text{NbN}$) films.
- **Finding**: The $\text{ScN}$ buffer layer significantly improved the superconducting characteristics of $29 \text{ nm}$ thick $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing the critical temperature $T_c$ from $9 \text{ K}$ to $12.5 \text{ K}$. This enhancement is attributed to better lattice matching, resulting in a higher quality $\text{NbN}$ crystal lattice, a conclusion confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) data.

**13. [Hydrothermal synthesis of SnO2 particles for the degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) dye in presence of sunlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13137v1)**
- **Authors**: Komal Singh, Jyoti Sindkar, Mrunal Ramdasi, Vrishali Jadhav, Rohidas B. Kale
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To synthesize $\text{SnO}_2$ nanoparticles via the hydrothermal method, investigate the effect of surfactants on their characteristics, and evaluate their photocatalytic activity for Methylene Blue degradation.
- **Finding**: X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of a tetragonal rutile $\text{SnO}_2$ phase. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology, revealing that changing the surfactant significantly impacts the size and shape of the nanoparticles. SEM also showed that samples with higher precursor concentration exhibited aggregation due to smaller particle size, which affects their suitability for photocatalysis.

**14. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: To report a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ at room temperature and determine the underlying physical mechanism.
- **Finding**: The EO effect originates from defect-bound unpaired electrons whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched by magnetic-field-induced formation of room-temperature skyrmion states. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) was used to directly visualize this collective spin ordering (skyrmion states), confirming that the magnetic field transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, resulting in an orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the EO coefficient.

- **Authors**: A. A. Shiryaev, E. F. Vasilev, A. L. Vasilev, V. V. Artemov, N. V. Gubanov, D. A. Zedgenizov
- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural nature of "Y-defects" in a natural Ib-IaA diamond crystal using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.
- **Finding**: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis of the Y-defect rich zone revealed dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects. Crucially, TEM observed extended defects resembling thin ($1-3 \text{ nm}$) rhombic plates, which contrast analysis identified as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) up to $20 \text{ nm}$ in size. These nanovoids are suggested to be the internal walls responsible for the observed unusual, blinking photoluminescence lines.

**17. [Nano-engineered surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy substrates for probing tissue-material interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11651v1)**
- **Authors**: Connie M. Wang, Roberta M. Sabino, Aditya Garg, Ahmed E. Salih, Loza F. Tadesse, Elazer R. Edelman
- **Date**: 2025-12-12
- **Objective**: To develop a multifunctional, self-sensing implant material composed of gold nano-columns ($\text{AuNCs}$) on titanium ($\text{AuNC-Ti}$) to serve as a Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrate for non-invasive monitoring of tissue-implant interactions.
- **Finding**: The $\text{AuNC-Ti}$ SERS substrates were fabricated using oblique angle deposition (OAD). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology, confirming the uniform formation of $\text{AuNCs}$ with controlled dimensions ($360 \pm 40 \text{ nm}$ in length and $50 \pm 16 \text{ nm}$ in width), which are necessary for achieving the high SERS enhancement factor ($1.8 \times 10^5$).

**18. [Thermal and Size Effects in Ferroelastic Domains by Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10629v1)**
- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate how temperature influences the thickness-dependent behavior of ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: *In situ* heating Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was combined with a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach to track DW dynamics. The results mapped the evolution of DWs across thermal regimes, showing a distinct interplay: DWs were mobile and curved in the dipolar regime but nearly static with minimal reconfiguration in the crossover regime ($200-300 \text{ nm}$ thickness), revealing how thickness and temperature govern DW morphology and dynamics.

**19. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To image nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{B}20$-structured $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ using Fresnel Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) and to investigate the limitations of conventional chiral discrimination methods for ultrasmall skyrmions.
- **Finding**: LTEM studies in Fresnel mode revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon when analyzing defocus-dependent images. Systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations attributed these chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation of the contrast transfer function (CTF), establishing quantitative limitations of Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall skyrmions and providing insights into defocus-mediated phase-to-intensity conversion.

**20. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies observed in $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet and determine if they arise from chiral spin textures (Topological Hall Effect).
- **Finding**: Although Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, they lacked correlation with magnetic transitions typical of chiral spin texture hosts. Most importantly, additional Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) measurements were performed and definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. The anomalies were instead attributed to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity, urging caution in interpreting transport data alone in bulk systems.

**21. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust, constraint-free phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) that utilizes untrained coordinate-based neural fields and a physics-consistent forward model.
- **Finding**: CDIP eliminates the need for object-specific constraints, which traditionally limit CDI's stability and applicability. The framework demonstrated substantial superiority over classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability for both static and dynamic reconstructions. This advancement is broadly applicable to coherent imaging modalities, including ptychography and holography, across X-ray, optical, and electron probes (essential for high-resolution EM).

**22. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings, integrating modeling, simulation, and experimental validation.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and micromagnetic simulations predicted strain-induced elongation and tilting of skyrmion strings, leading to rupture via bobber formation. Experimental validation using *in situ* Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary control mechanism.

**23. [Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09067v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To investigate and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of neural network segmentation models used for High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) imaging, specifically concerning variations in imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: By using synthetic data generated via multislice simulation and leveraging the HRTEM Contrast Transfer Function (CTF), the study developed a framework to quantify OOD domain shifts. It demonstrated that neural network segmentation models exhibit performance stability but predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution, providing a crucial tool for assessing model reliability in experimental HRTEM workflows.

**24. [Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07285v1)**
- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the critical influence of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnet alloys.
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis of $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys revealed a significant compressive strain, up to $25\%$, localized near grain boundaries. Theoretical calculations, using this experimentally determined strain as input, showed that while $K_{\rm u}$ is positive under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions subjected to $25\%$ compressive strain, highlighting the critical role of nanoscale lattice distortions in determining magnetic properties.

- **Authors**: Giannis Thalassinos, Alan G. Salek, Daniel Stavrevski, Qiang Sun, Mitchell O. de Vries, Colin M. MacRae, Nicholas C. Wilson, Andrew G. Tomkins, Dougal G. McCulloch, Andrew D. Greentree
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence of a photoluminescent color center (RU1) hosted within meteoritic lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond).
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable fluorescence with an excited-state lifetime of $14 \text{ ns}$. Correlative electron microscopy was essential to confirm the lonsdaleite host lattice structure. Compositional analysis performed during the EM investigation suggested plausible defect constituents ($\text{N}$, $\text{Si}$, or $\text{Ni}$), establishing lonsdaleite as a potential new platform for solid-state quantum emitters.

**26. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To investigate the spatial evolution and underlying mechanisms of strain-induced magnetic helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress.
- **Finding**: Uniaxial tensile stress causes magnetic helical domain reorientation mediated by topological magnetic defects, which propagate via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes, strikingly similar to plastic deformation in metals. *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) was essential for manipulating and directly observing this reorientation and the dynamics of the magnetic defects under applied stress.

**27. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the magnetic textures, specifically surface spirals (SS), that emerge adjacent to ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) and elucidate the role of the phase factor ($\phi_0$).
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that the intrinsic phase factor ($\phi_0$) controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of surface spirals (SS) at FCIs, with a discontinuity point where spirals with opposite charges form. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed the formation of SSs at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, revealing two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation.

- **Authors**: Akira Miura, Woohyeon Baek, Yuta Fujii, Kiyoharu Tadanaga, Rana Hossain, Aichi Yamashita, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Chikako Moriyoshi, Shintaro Kobayashi, Shogo Kawaguchi, Jiong Ding, Shigeo Mori, Atsushi Sakuda, Akitoshi Hayashi, Wenhao Sun
- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox of the synthesizability and anomalous stability of the metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ solid-state electrolyte by constructing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: The TTT diagram, supported by DFT calculations, showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to low surface energy, drastically lowering the nucleation barrier. Electron microscopy, alongside *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction, provided direct visualization of this size-dependent stabilization, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase particles and their subsequent slow transformation.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) significantly higher than the previously reported $\sim 40 \text{ K}$ cap in nickelate thin films.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset was achieved at $\sim 63 \text{ K}$ in epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity of these films, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase and enabling the enhanced $T_c$.

**30. [Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04045v1)**
- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a computationally efficient, self-supervised machine learning (ML) pipeline for denoising low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time-series high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, suitable for *in situ* analysis.
- **Finding**: The proposed pipeline, which utilizes a blind-spot convolution neural network, significantly outperformed other ML and non-ML methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features in HRTEM images. Crucially, the model achieved inference speeds in the order of milliseconds per image, demonstrating excellent out-of-distribution generalization and making it viable for real-time *in situ* HRTEM experiments.

**31. [Resolving Structural Transitions in Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03881v1)**
- **Authors**: Billy E. Yang, Saeed S. I. Almishal, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Mary Kathleen Caucci, Gerald Bejger, Christina M. Rost, Nasim Alem, Susan B. Sinnott, Jon-Paul Maria
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2-\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and resolve the stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive, multi-length-scale characterization suite was necessary to identify boundaries between the closely related phases. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction confirmed the crystal structures, while the companion thin film study demonstrated that quenched kinetic energy can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase even with only $20\%$ Ce, requiring an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the $\text{Co } 3d$ orbital occupancy in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ thin films through interfacial engineering with various perovskite oxides ($\text{LaTiO}_3$, $\text{LaMnO}_3$, $\text{LaAlO}_3$, and $\text{LaNiO}_3$).
- **Finding**: Interfacial engineering successfully tuned the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy from a partial $d^7$ state to a partial $d^5$ state, and a $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer resulted in a $\text{Co } d^6$ low spin state.

- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize novel hexagonal $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions by subjecting Ge and Sn to high pressures and temperatures, overcoming their ambient unreactivity and structural limitations.
- **Finding**: High-pressure (9 to $10 \text{ GPa}$) and high-temperature synthesis successfully created and allowed ambient pressure recovery of novel hexagonal $2\text{H}$, $4\text{H}$, and $6\text{H}$ $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions ($\text{P}6_3/\text{mmc}$). Precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy were critical in confirming the hexagonal crystal symmetry and correlating its formation with Sn uptake below $21 \text{ atom } \% \text{ Sn}$.

- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To establish quantitative correlations between microstructural evolution induced by aging heat treatments and the mechanical performance, particularly impact toughness, of PBF-LB produced 17-4 PH stainless steel.
- **Finding**: PBF-LB specimens showed high tensile strength but consistently lower impact toughness than conventionally manufactured counterparts. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) revealed that $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions acted as nucleation sites for micro-cavities, severely limiting impact toughness, while the distribution of $\text{Cu}$-rich nanoprecipitates could be tailored to optimize either tensile strength (Orowan strengthening) or impact toughness, highlighting a pronounced strength-toughness trade-off.

**35. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC)-STEM.
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations demonstrated that defocus significantly impacts accuracy, with electrostatic field magnitude underestimated by up to $30\%$ for a $30 \text{ mrad}$ probe at certain defocus limits. Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations exceeding $40\%$. This analysis confirms the high sensitivity of DPC-STEM and stresses the crucial need for optimized instrumental alignment to ensure accurate Center of Mass (CoM) based STEM imaging.

- **Authors**: Jisun Kim, Yoosuk Kim, Seung-Ho Park, Yong Hun Ko, Chong-Yun Park
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: To develop a scalable thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy for synthesizing uniform, large-area $\text{WS}_2$ thin films from tungsten precursors and demonstrate their application in photovoltaic devices.

**41. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize a new class of coherent crystalline interfaces, termed e-coherent, where local non-affine transformations lead to enhanced coherency.
- **Finding**: E-coherent interfaces achieve enhanced coherency through non-affine relaxations that introduce unique line defects called discohesions (topologically equivalent to disconnection dipoles or loops). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomistic simulations demonstrated that the energetics and kinetics of these interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content, suggesting that e-coherency is a pervasive phenomenon in crystalline solids.

- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce a novel electron linear dichroism methodology in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) capable of probing electronic anisotropies and orbital polarization with atomic resolution.
- **Finding**: By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in STEM, the $\text{Mn}-3d \text{ } e_g$ orbital polarization was directly visualized with sub-angstrom precision in strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_3$ thin films. This technique resolved that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^2-r^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^2-y^2$, achieving the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity necessary for studying symmetry-breaking phenomena at interfaces.
