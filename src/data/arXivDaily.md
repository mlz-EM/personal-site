- **Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Objective**: Investigate the relationship between structural disorder and the establishment of superconducting phase coherence in a highly disordered fractal MgO/$MgB_2$ nanocomposite.
- **Finding**: 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) revealed an isotropic, complex MgO/$MgB_2$ microstructure with a constant fractal dimension of $\sim1.67$ spreading throughout the sample.

- **Authors**: M. D. Dong, X. B. Cheng, M. Zhang, J. Wu
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Objective**: Discover and investigate the coexistence and strong coupling of ferroelectric and superconducting orders at the interface of $LaAlO_3/KTaO_3(111)$ (LAO/KTO) heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Ferroelectric order was discovered at the LAO/KTO interface, where it coexists with superconductivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that K ions are displaced relative to Ta ions, with the help of oxygen vacancies at the LAO/KTO interface, providing atomic-scale evidence for the ferroelectric polarization. Manipulating this ferroelectricity changed interfacial conductivity by more than 1000 times, simultaneously causing superconductivity to diminish and reappear due to the strong coupling between these phenomena, and the ferroelectric hysteresis correlated with changes in interfacial conductivity and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$).

- **Authors**: Sebastian Lellig, Subisha Balakumar, Peter Schweizer, Eva P. Mayer, Simon Evertz, Marcus Hans, Damian M. Holzapfel, Yin Du, Qing Zhou, Martin Dienwiebel, Johann Michler, Jochen M. Schneider
- **Date**: 2025-06-13
- **Objective**: Design artificial sulfur-free zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by controlling their chain length through annealing.
- **Finding**: As-deposited zinc phosphate coatings, sputtered from a $Zn_3(PO_4)_2$ target, were classified as metaphosphates. Annealing reduced their chain lengths, as evidenced by XPS data indicating a loss of phosphorus and oxygen from the coating surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line scans directly showed that this composition change occurred over the whole thickness of the coating, confirming the alteration in chain length. This alteration in composition and chain length led to a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and improved wear resistance, demonstrating that the mechanical properties of artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via thermally stimulated composition changes.
