It also demonstrated 4D (*in situ*) characterization by tracking the dynamic evolution of surface nanostructure during copper redox, revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics.

**33. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) is varied, focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) revealed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ drops below $30\ \text{Å}$. Transport measurements showed clear divergence near this threshold. The Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism crosses over from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution in thick films to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism ($n = 0.62$) in the high-resistive percolative films.

- **Authors**: Siyu Wang, Chao Wang, Yanan Yuan, Jiangxiao Li, Fangfang Pei, Daxiang Liu, Chunyu Qin, Jiefeng Cao, Yamei Wang, Tianye Wang, Jiayu Liu, Jieun Lee, Guanhua Zhang, Christoph Klewe, Chenchao Yu, Fan Zhang, Dongsheng Song, Kai Chen, Weisheng Zhao, Dawei Shen, Ziqiang Qiu, Mengmeng Yang, Bin Hong, Qian Li
- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To definitively determine the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ films, a candidate altermagnet, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
- **Finding**: The observed XLD signal in $\text{RuO}_2$ films, characterized in conjunction with Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM), was nearly invariant with temperature and cooling field direction, contradicting predictions for substantial magnetic order-related XLD. This strongly suggests the absence of magnetic order and a nonmagnetic origin for $\text{RuO}_2$. Distinct XLD signals at the $\text{Ru}\ M_3$ and $\text{O}\ K$ edges are attributed to low-symmetry crystal fields.

- **Objective**: To achieve epitaxial stabilization and characterization of the metastable tantalum dioxide ($\text{TaO}_2$) thin films on $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ substrates.
- **Finding**: Single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained $\text{TaO}_2$ was achieved using suboxide MBE and TLE. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) confirmed the microstructure. Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray methods confirmed the tetravalent oxidation state ($\text{Ta}^{4+}$). Optical properties revealed a $0.3\ \text{eV}$ Mott gap, suggesting the potential for a metal-insulator transition akin to $\text{NbO}_2$.

- **Authors**: Alessia Fischetti, Giacometta Mineo, Daniela Russo, Francesco Salutari, Claudio Lentini Campallegio, Elena Bruno, Jordi Arbiol, Giorgia Franzò, Salvatore Mirabella, Vincenzina Strano, M. Chiara Spadaro
- **Date**: 2026-01-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the electrochemical energy storage mechanism and performance of hydrothermally grown $\text{ZnO}/\text{ZnS}$ nanostructures decorating $\text{Ni}$ foam.
- **Finding**: The $\text{ZnO}/\text{ZnS}$ system on $\text{Ni}$ foam exhibits a predominant pseudocapacitive behavior, significantly better than when deposited on graphene paper. Electron microscopy-based methodologies were used to evaluate morphology, structure, and composition. Mott-Schottky measurements suggest that the $\text{ZnS}$ decoration enhances performance by acting as a key hole reservoir.

**37. [On the Feasibility of Extreme Heating Rates in SEM using MEMS Heater Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05831v1)**
- **Authors**: C. Koenig, P. Mayr, J. R. Jinschek, A. Bastos Fanta
- **Date**: 2026-01-09

- **Finding**: Stable heating and cooling rates up to $1000\ ^{\circ}\text{C}/\text{s}$ were achieved in vacuum using MEMS platforms. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) within the SEM successfully tracked the ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation in pure iron *in situ* without compromising pattern quality, establishing this technique for quantitative studies of rapid, thermally activated phenomena.

- **Authors**: Callum Brennan-Rich, Sean M. Collins, Stuart Micklethwaite, Zabeada Aslam, Trevor Almeida, Stephen McVitie, Rik M. Drummond-Brydson, Christopher H. Marrows
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize the structural and magnetic properties of epitaxial $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$ and $\text{FeSn}$ kagome thin films grown by co-sputtering.
- **Finding**: High-quality epitaxial thin films of ferromagnetic $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$, antiferromagnetic $\text{FeSn}$, and mixed-phase intergrowths were successfully produced. Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM) was crucial for characterizing the crystallographic phase content, revealing intergrowths of both phases. A unique behavior in the temperature-dependent coercivity was discovered specifically in the highly mixed-phase alloys.

- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To establish a micro-pulling-down ($\mu\text{PD}$) apparatus for growing $\text{NiTi}$ single crystals and to provide a detailed characterization of the resulting material.
- **Finding**: The $\mu\text{PD}$ method successfully produced $\text{NiTi}$ single crystals with reduced oxygen contamination. Detailed characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) confirmed the crystal structure, composition, and orientation, providing essential data for studying the phase transition characteristics.

**40. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\alpha-\text{Mn}$ precipitate size and volume fraction in a $\text{Mg}-\text{Mn}$ alloy during room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT).
- **Finding**: The volume fraction of nm-scale $\alpha-\text{Mn}$ particles increased with applied strain during HPT. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis of the precipitate size distribution, combined with SAXS/WAXS data, showed that the mean particle size did not increase over the course of HPT, suggesting that precipitate growth is subject to interfacial control rather than diffusional control.

- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To quantify the influence of residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity on the interface structure and potential qubit properties in strained-silicon ($\text{s}-\text{Si}$)/$\text{Si}_{0.7}\text{Ge}_{0.3}$ heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Spatially-aligned images of strain (Raman) and interface structure (AFM and Cross-sectional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy, STEM) revealed a strong interplay between strain and roughness. Modeling suggests that residual strain inhomogeneity could lead to spurious double-dot qubit detunings of $0.1\ \text{meV}$ over $100\ \text{nm}$ distances.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a new layered material, $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$.
- **Finding**: $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$ crystallizes in space group $R\bar{3}m$, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirmed the crystal structure alongside single crystal X-ray diffraction. Unlike its ferromagnetic telluride analog, this compound displays antiferromagnetic order below $50\ \text{K}$, with an effective moment consistent with $\text{Cr}^{3+}$ oxidation.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analysis of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) in $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}$-encapsulated $\text{Nb}$ thin films used for superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Atom-probe tomography (APT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed oxygen segregation at GBs in both $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}/\text{Nb}$ films. The oxygen enrichment factor ($C_{\text{gb}}/C_{\text{grain}}$) is $2.7$ for $\text{Nb}$ films. Increased oxygen concentration in both $\text{Nb}$ grains and GBs correlates with a suppression in the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), providing atomic-scale insight into a potential decoherence mechanism.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) provided clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure, confirming the computational prediction. The material exhibits a high threshold field combined with a high breakdown field ($\approx 6\ \text{MV}/\text{cm}$), promising for energy-storage applications.

- **Authors**: Jianyu Wu, Arthur Niedermayr, Gaolong Cao, Oscar Grånäs, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To achieve spatially selective and ultrafast control over quantum states by using femtosecond laser excitation to pattern topological phase transitions in the Weyl semimetal $\text{WTe}_2$.
- **Finding**: By engineering the excitation field into a transient optical grating, the topological $\text{T}_{\text{d}}$ phase and trivial $\text{1T}^*$ phase of $\text{WTe}_2$ were reversibly patterned. Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy (UTEM) directly visualized the formation of the periodic $\text{T}_{\text{d}}/\text{1T}^*$ heterostructure, observed phase front propagation, and analyzed nanoscale confinement of coherently excited optical phonon modes.

**47. [Structural heterogeneity-induced enhancement of transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion revealed by thermoelectric imaging in functionally graded materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03581v1)**
- **Authors**: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To investigate how graded structural heterogeneity enhances transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion (Anomalous Ettingshausen effect) in functionally graded materials (FGMs).
- **Finding**: FGMs fabricated by temperature-gradient annealing showed a pronounced non-monotonic enhancement of the Anomalous Ettingshausen effect, peaking in the atomic-heterogeneity regime before crystallization. Structural analyses using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed that the enhanced response is due to the formation of $\text{Fe}$-based crystalline alloys and $\text{Cu}$ nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix.

- **Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Objective**: To visualize the energy dependence of orbital nematicity in real space within individual nematic domains of the $\text{Fe}$-based superconductor $\text{Ba}_{1-x}\text{Na}_x\text{Fe}_2\text{As}_2$.
- **Finding**: Using laser-excited Photoemission Electron Microscopy (laser-PEEM) with an energy-selective slit, the evolution of linear dichroic (LD) contrast was visualized within individual nematic domains. A sign reversal of the LD contrast was discovered at an energy $\sim 0.4\ \text{eV}$ below the Fermi level, directly revealing an inversion of orbital anisotropy and highlighting the role of orbital-selective coherence.

- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop a full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction that considers the two-photon process, unifying the understanding of PINEM, Kapitza-Dirac (KD), and nonlinear Compton scattering effects.
- **Finding**: The full quantum theory reveals that the emission/absorption of two photons by free electrons can be significantly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of the optical near field (relevant to PINEM, Photon-Induced Near-field Electron Microscopy). Quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes is predicted. The KD effect and nonlinear Compton scattering are analytically deduced as two-photon processes.
