- **Finding**: OMR enabled continuous modulation of the $\text{Ni}$ $3d$ orbital electron occupancy from $\sim 3d^7$ to $\sim 3d^9$. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms, combined with synchrotron X-ray absorption, was crucial for calibrating the $3d$ occupancy. The SIT exhibits a mixture of 2D and 3D superconducting characters, deviating from the canonical 2D model.

**34. [Nanoparticle Self-assembly Assisted by Polymers: The Role of Shear Stress in the Nanoparticle Arrangement of Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13842v1)**
- **Authors**: Beatriz Martín-García, M. Mercedes Velázquez
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To study how shear stress, induced by compression-expansion cycles, affects the self-assembly and morphology of $\text{CdSe}$ quantum dots (QDs) assisted by a block copolymer in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films.
- **Finding**: Shear stress removes nanoparticles from metastable states at the air-water interface, promoting a new equilibrium state. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) measurements of the transferred LB films showed that increasing the amplitude strain leads to smaller QD domain sizes and a more ordered film structure.

- **Authors**: Miran Joo, Huixin Xiu, Sabrina Baha, Ridha Zerdoumi, Ningyan Cheng, Christoph Somsen, Yujiao Li, Aleksander Kostka, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Alfred Ludwig, Christina Scheu
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To investigate the correlation between $\text{Ru}$ content, microstructural defects, and electrocatalytic activity in $\text{Au-Pd-Pt-Ru}$ compositionally complex solid solution (CCSS) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing $\text{Ru}$ content enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction activity and causes a structural transition from high-density nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults. Electron microscopy (equipped with EDX) characterized the structure, and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed local compositional fluctuations (enrichment/depletion) at grain boundaries, providing insight into performance enhancement mechanisms.

- **Authors**: Bowen Zou, Yixu Wang, Xiao Shen, Philipp Krooss, Thomas Niendorf, Richard Dronskowski, Wenwen Song
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To reveal the elemental redistribution and interaction mechanisms during the co-precipitation of nanosized $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ phases in an $\text{Al}$-alloyed $\text{Fe-Mn-Ni-C}$ steel matrix.
- **Finding**: Two co-nanoprecipitation modes were observed. Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed that $\text{B}2$ precipitates next to $\kappa$ (B2I) are $\text{FeAl}$-type, while isolated $\text{B}2$ (B2II) are $\text{NiAl}$-type. Correlative Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Transmission Electron Microscopy (TKD-TEM) confirmed the structure, and APT quantified the $\text{Fe-Ni}$ atomic exchange between the phases, which improves their stability during co-precipitation.

**39. [Discovery of Ferroelectric Twin Boundaries in a Photoactive Halide Perovskite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12892v1)**
- **Authors**: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To discover and characterize the existence and nature of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited photoactive $\text{CsPbI}_3$ thin films and their potential ferroelectric behavior.
- **Finding**: Ferroelastic twin boundaries parallel to $\{110\}$ and $\{112\}$ planes were discovered. Low-dose Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) directly revealed that $\text{Pb}$ atoms shift at the $\{110\}$ twin boundaries, driving a local ferroelectric-like polarization, despite the bulk material being non-polar. This uncovers previously hidden ferroic functionality for domain wall engineering.

- **Finding**: The $\text{BaTiO}_3$ ceramics exhibit colossal relative dielectric permittivity ($\sim 10^5 - 10^6$) and conduction governed by the Mott variable range hopping mechanism. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to estimate the concentration and distribution of carbon impurity, showing that larger carbon concentration correlates with smaller permittivity and resistivity in the Mott hopping regime.

- **Authors**: Hao-Jin Wang, Liqun Shen, Xin-Ning Tian, Lei Lei, Kexin Wang, Grigore Moldovan, Marc-Georg Willinger, Zhu-Jun Wang
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To develop a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that couples a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning for quantitative 3D and 4D nanometrology using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).
- **Finding**: The framework achieved single-shot, quantitative 3D nanometrology with high precision and throughput, comparable to AFM. This synergy enabled 4D (3D real space plus time) in situ characterization, demonstrated by tracking the dynamic evolution of surface nanostructure during copper redox, revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics invisible to conventional SEM imaging.

**46. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the percolation-driven transition in structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) is varied.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ decreased below $30\ \text{\AA}$. This structural change correlates with a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism, transitioning from mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution in thick films to a skew-scattering dominant mechanism in the high-resistive, percolative films.

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To definitively determine the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ films, a candidate for altermagnetism, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
- **Finding**: The XLD signal observed in $\text{RuO}_2$ was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field direction, strongly suggesting a nonmagnetic origin, contrary to predictions of substantial magnetic order. Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) was used in conjunction with XLD measurements to characterize the films and attribute distinct XLD signals to low-symmetry crystal field effects.
