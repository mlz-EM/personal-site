- **Finding**: LTEM Fresnel imaging, analyzed by the transport of intensity equation, demonstrated an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon for ultrasmall skyrmions. Systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations attributed these chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation of the contrast transfer function, establishing quantitative limitations for conventional Fresnel contrast analysis in nanoscale magnetic imaging.

**35. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the magnetic and transport properties of $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ and determine the origin of its topological-Hall-like resistivity anomaly.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed but showed little correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, distinguishing them from true topological Hall effects. Crucially, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures (such as skyrmions). The anomalies were therefore attributed to trivial mechanisms, specifically the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels arising from sample inhomogeneity.

**36. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework utilizing untrained coordinate-based neural fields to eliminate the need for handcrafted constraints in Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI).
- **Finding**: CDIP substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in fidelity and stability for both static and dynamic reconstructions. This constraint-free framework is broadly applicable to coherent imaging modalities, including electron probes (such as ptychography and holography), offering a paradigm shift by resolving the instability and ill-posedness traditionally hindering atomic-resolution imaging of non-crystalline specimens.

**37. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings using modeling, simulation, and experimental validation.
- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) experiments on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed that externally applied uniaxial strain induces elongation and subsequent collapse of the skyrmion lattice into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation. This demonstrates that strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the primary mechanism for energy-efficient manipulation of 3D magnetic systems.

**38. [Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09067v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models with respect to imaging conditions in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).
- **Finding**: By training and testing over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic HRTEM data, the study showed that network performance smoothly and predictably worsens as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. The HRTEM contrast transfer function was successfully used to develop a framework that quantifies OOD domain shifts, providing a crucial tool for the reliable deployment of neural networks in experimental HRTEM workflows.

**39. [Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07285v1)**
- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_u$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnet alloys.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed significant compressive strain, up to 25%, near grain boundaries in $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys. Calculations showed that while $K_u$ is positive under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain, demonstrating that lattice distortions visualized by STEM critically influence the magnetic properties of these materials.

- **Authors**: Giannis Thalassinos, Alan G. Salek, Daniel Stavrevski, Qiang Sun, Mitchell O. de Vries, Colin M. MacRae, Nicholas C. Wilson, Andrew G. Tomkins, Dougal G. McCulloch, Andrew D. Greentree
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of optically active photoluminescent color centers within meteoritic lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond).
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable emission (peak $\sim 700$ nm) with a 14 ns excited-state lifetime. Correlative electron microscopy confirmed the lonsdaleite host lattice structure, suggesting that hexagonal-diamond color centers, whose existence was structurally validated by EM, may constitute a new, unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters.

**41. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To manipulate and observe the spatial evolution of helical domain reorientation under uniaxial tensile stress using *in situ* techniques.
- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) revealed that the reorientation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) under stress is mediated by magnetic defects through processes analogous to plastic deformation in metals, such as "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation." This mechanism, potentially driven by strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, offers a route for energy-efficient magnetic nanophase control.

**42. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the emergence and control of surface spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) in chiral magnets, emphasizing the role of the phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed the formation of SS adjacent to FCIs and at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase. LTEM revealed two distinct SS formation pathways (co-growth and field-driven transformation), establishing $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states relevant for multi-state spintronic memory.

- **Authors**: Akira Miura, Woohyeon Baek, Yuta Fujii, Kiyoharu Tadanaga, Rana Hossain, Aichi Yamashita, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Chikako Moriyoshi, Shintaro Kobayashi, Shogo Kawaguchi, Jiong Ding, Shigeo Mori, Atsushi Sakuda, Akitoshi Hayashi, Wenhao Sun
- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox of the metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ solid-state electrolyte by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: Computational analysis showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to low surface energy, significantly lowering the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using *in situ* electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase particles and rationalizing its quenchability.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) exceeding 60 K in epitaxial nickelate thin films.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset was achieved at $\sim 63$ K in epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium method. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity and structural integrity of the strained phase, linking the high $T_c$ to non-Fermi liquid (strange-metal-like) behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$) and significantly stronger interlayer coupling.

**45. [Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04045v1)**
- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) denoising pipeline capable of handling low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and out-of-distribution (OOD) high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) datasets for *in situ* analysis.
- **Finding**: The proposed pipeline, based on a blind-spot convolution neural network, outperformed other ML and non-ML methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, improving the visual clarity of atomic features. Crucially, the model demonstrated excellent OOD generalization and an inference speed in the order of milliseconds per image, making it suitable for real-time application in *in situ* HRTEM experiments where high temporal resolution is required.

- **Authors**: Billy E. Yang, Saeed S. I. Almishal, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Mary Kathleen Caucci, Gerald Bejger, Christina M. Rost, Nasim Alem, Susan B. Sinnott, Jon-Paul Maria
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2$-$\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and resolve the stability regions of bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A multi-length-scale characterization package, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, was essential for identifying boundaries between closely related phases. TEM confirmed that quenched kinetic energy in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase even with a high concentration of oxygen sublattice vacancies (estimated 16.7%), demonstrating the role of synthesis kinetics in engineering HEO structures.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the $\text{Co}$ $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ thin films through interfacial engineering with various perovskite oxide heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Interfacial engineering successfully tuned the $\text{Co}$ orbital occupancy from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed a clear connection between the strain state at the oxide interfaces and the resulting $\text{Co}$ spin configuration, demonstrating that interfacial engineering simultaneously governs both orbital occupancy and spin state in correlated oxides.

**48. [High Pressure and Compositionally Directed Route to a Hexagonal $\text{GeSn}$ Alloy Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03602v1)**
- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize a new class of hexagonal $\text{GeSn}$ solid solution alloys using high pressure and temperature methods.
- **Finding**: Applying pressures up to 10 GPa and temperatures up to 1500 K led to the ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions ($\text{P}6_3/\text{mmc}$). Precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy confirmed the hexagonal symmetry and correlated its formation with $\text{Sn}$ uptake (accessible below 21 atom % $\text{Sn}$), opening new routes for tuning optoelectronic properties.

**49. [On the relation between microstructure and impact toughness of 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14702v1)**
- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To establish quantitative correlations between the microstructural evolution induced by aging heat treatments and the mechanical performance (especially impact toughness) of 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by PBF-LB.
- **Finding**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the distribution of $\text{Cu}$-rich nanoprecipitates could be tailored to optimize either tensile strength or impact toughness, but not both simultaneously. SEM also identified $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions from the starting powder as detrimental nucleation sites for micro-cavities, explaining the consistently lower impact toughness compared to conventionally manufactured counterparts.

**50. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using differential phase contrast (DPC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations showed that DPC-STEM measurements are highly sensitive to instrumental configuration; for instance, a 21 mrad defocused probe can underestimate the electrostatic field magnitude by up to 16% at the interpretability limit of 4 nm. The analysis confirms the utility of the scattergram-based method but stresses the critical importance of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate Center of Mass ($\text{CoM}$) based STEM imaging.
