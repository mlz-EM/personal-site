- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To revisit contrast transfer mechanisms in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to understand information encoding and identify new imaging modes.

**30. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware metric for assessing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, addressing the limitations of the conventional contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that while CTF overestimates practical performance by neglecting finite electron fluence and Poisson-limited detection, SSNR accurately reflects the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Numerical reconstructions show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, whereas iterative ptychography shows a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography at low fluence and saturating at high fluence. The results highlight SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for evaluating STEM phase retrieval methods.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation to probe weak magnetic dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ ions.
- **Finding**: The study successfully generated spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses optimized for selective excitation of magnetic and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. Excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam provided a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition compared to other beams. This setup offers new opportunities for the spectroscopy of forbidden transitions.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the atomic-scale dipole organization within the polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, specifically focusing on the formation and characteristics of 180-degree domain walls.
- **Finding**: Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film in plan view, the study revealed strikingly non-uniform dipole organization within irreducibly narrow polar layers. It showed the formation of atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls, at most a few unit cells long, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations. These walls adopt distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-nm$^2$ footprint, representing some of the smallest reported domains in polar materials. This work demonstrates a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale, opening new pathways for atomically dense memories.

- **Authors**: Pengcheng Li, Chenglin Pua, Zehao Dong, Zhengxiong Su, Tao Liu, Chao Cai, Huahai Shen, Lin Gu, Zhen Chen
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To overcome the challenges of precisely determining atomic-scale hydrogen distribution in materials by demonstrating the capabilities of multislice electron ptychography (MEP).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes the limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy for hydrogen detection, offering exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work establishes MEP as a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.

- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements of direct ptychography by formulating parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography.
- **Finding**: The study formulates parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, using this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. This approach relaxes the traditional resolution limitation of direct ptychography, which is typically constrained by the probe step size and stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. The work demonstrates analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions, showing that this method permits optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques under the weak phase object approximation.

**35. [Programmable phase selection between altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe on InP via molecular beam epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18592v1)**
- **Authors**: An-Hsi Chen, Parul R. Raghuvanshi, Jacob Cook, Michael Chilcote, Jason Lapano, Alessandro R. Mazza, Qiangsheng Lu, Sangsoo Kim, Yueh-Chun Wu, T. Zac Ward, Benjamin Lawrie, Guang Bian, James Burns, Jonathan D. Poplawsky, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Lucas Lindsay, Hu Miao, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Valentino R. Cooper, Matthew Brahlek
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe with high structural quality and phase purity can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that bulk altermagnetic MnTe (hexagonal NiAs-structure) is selectively grown on the (111)A surface (In-terminated) of InP, while the non-centrosymmetric, cubic ZnS-structure is stabilized on the (111)B surface (P-terminated). Electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction indicated that phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface. First-principles calculations suggested that interfacial termination and strain significantly affect the interfacial energy, stabilizing the respective polymorphs. Electron microscopy was used for structural characterization of the grown films.

- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To experimentally demonstrate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during the ultrafast magnetostructural phase transition in FeRh thin films.
- **Finding**: Using high structural and magnetic resolution in situ transmission electron microscopy, the study observed that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, causing it to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This led to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices as preferential nucleation motifs, which are pinned by underlying dislocation networks formed and rearranged upon repeated laser pulse crossings. These results establish a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films using accelerator-based fast ion implantation.
- **Finding**: The study successfully used high-energy ion implantation to enhance the NLMR in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films, with surface-doped films showing a maximum NLMR around $B = 7$ T and bulk-doped films over $B = 9$ T. This represents more than a 100% relative enhancement compared to pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films ($B = 4$ T), while maintaining crystallinity. Electrical transport and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the NLMR and the crystallinity, respectively, confirming the material's structural integrity after implantation.

**38. [Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940v2)**
- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs).
- **Finding**: Silica nanoparticles functionalized with oligonucleotides were optically trapped by a 1550 nm laser in vacuum, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude were precisely detected by optical interferometry. Data revealed differences in frequency, width, and amplitude of peaks between functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs, which were explained by a theoretical model and successfully distinguished using linear discriminant analysis and random forest modeling. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types, highlighting the sensitivity of the optomechanical detection method.

**39. [Computation and Sensitivity Analysis of the Deformation-Gradient Tensor Reconstruction in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17929v1)**
- **Authors**: Brinthan Kanesalingam, Darshan Chalise, Carsten Detlefs, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To develop an inverse modeling framework for Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) that explicitly relates angular shifts to the strain and lattice rotation tensors, and to perform sensitivity analysis for the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor.
- **Finding**: The study developed an inverse modeling formalism for DFXM, demonstrating that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible using oblique diffraction geometry. A computational framework was established for both forward calculation of anticipated angular shifts and reconstruction of the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for an individual pixel from DFXM experiments. Furthermore, methods for sensitivity analysis were presented to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific DFXM angles and to explicitly compute associated errors, assisting in the interpretation and design of DFXM experiments.

- **Authors**: Christian K. Belardi, Chia-Hao Lee, Yingheng Wang, Justin Lovelace, Kilian Q. Weinberger, David A. Muller, Carla P. Gomes
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To improve the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes in multislice electron ptychography (MEP) by integrating a generative prior based on a diffusion model.
- **Finding**: The study developed MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP, which can be easily integrated as a generative prior into existing iterative solvers via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). This hybrid approach significantly enhanced the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods, thereby addressing the ill-posed nature and time-consuming aspects of traditional MEP algorithms.

- **Authors**: C. R. Zeiger, R. S. Dragland, R. Sjökvist, R. Beanland, D. Meier, T. Grande, M. S. Senn, O. G. Grendal
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality in tetragonal tungsten bronzes and investigate the origin of their chirality and its coupling to external electric-strain fields.
- **Finding**: Ferrochirality was demonstrated in K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$. High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) solved their incommensurately modulated and chiral structures. Temperature-dependent XRD revealed an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from P4/mbm to P4$_2$12(00$\gamma$)q00, with chirality originating from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms. A spatially varying piezoelectric response was observed as a secondary effect, and invariant analysis proposed an external electric-strain-field coupling for switching chirality. TEM was used for detailed structural characterization, complementing the X-ray diffraction data.

**42. [Mechanistic Insights into Nonthermal Ablation of Copper Nanoparticles under Femtosecond Laser Irradiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17100v1)**
- **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanisms of undesired nonthermal ablation during femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation of copper (Cu) nanoparticles, particularly focusing on fragmentation and coalescence behaviors relevant to sintering applications.
- **Finding**: Particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a bimodal transformation of Cu nanoparticles under fs laser scanning: emergence of sub-60 nm debris and formation of large aggregates up to 750 nm. Analysis ruled out Coulomb explosion and identified hot electron blast as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa. Moderate lattice heating ($\sim$930 K) enabled softening and fusion of partially fragmented particles. This work highlights that reducing hot electron temperature can effectively suppress ablation and expand the sintering window for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing. SEM was crucial for characterizing the particle size distributions and morphological transformations.

- **Authors**: Shamail Ahmed, Federico Rossi, Hanyu Huo, Johannes Haust, Franziska Hueppe, Juergen Belz, Andreas Beyer, Juergen Janek, Kerstin Volz
- **Date**: 2025-07-22
- **Objective**: To investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling, aiming to understand the transition from crystalline to amorphous phases.
- **Finding**: Using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the study revealed that after the first lithiation, the silicon electrode exhibited a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li$_{15}$Si$_4$, various amorphous Li$_x$Si phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features and minimal remaining crystallinity. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure was more uniform, with thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries. The results show that a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles, suggesting that the starting material and electrode architecture are crucial for minimizing cracking and stabilizing the microstructure throughout cycling. Cryo-STEM was essential for preserving and observing the microstructure without ambient exposure.

- **Authors**: B. Huang, Y. Q. Yang, M. H. Li, Y. X. Chen, X. Luo, M. S. Fu, Y. Chen, Xierong Zeng
- **Date**: 2025-07-21
- **Objective**: To investigate the local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fibers, which are important for reinforced metal matrix composites, using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: The study found that at the first deposition stage, SiC grains had an almost random preferred direction and scattered grain sizes. At the second and third stages, two kinds of texture, (110) and (111) and (110) and (115), were observed. Grain sizes at the second and third stages were around 200 nm, with the third stage having smaller grains due to lower temperature. The [110] preferred direction along the axial direction was found to be beneficial for axial tensile strength. PED on TEM provided detailed local texture information, which was in agreement with XRD results.

- **Authors**: Oliver Lin, Zhiheng Lyu, Hsu-Chih Ni, Xiaokang Wang, Yetong Jia, Chu-Yun Hwang, Lehan Yao, Jian-Min Zuo, Qian Chen
- **Date**: 2025-07-20
- **Objective**: To understand the fundamental structural characteristics of multi-twinned decahedral nanoparticles, particularly how intrinsic lattice strain and emergent pseudosymmetry vary with particle size.
- **Finding**: Using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) strain mapping on 23 decahedral nanoparticles (20-55 nm edge lengths), the study revealed the prevalence of heterogeneity in different modes of lattice distortions that homogenizes and restores symmetry with increasing size. Distinct spatial patterns of local lattice phase transformation between face-centered cubic and body-centered tetragonal symmetries were observed, with a crossover size around $d = 35$ nm, suggesting an internal structural transition as particle shape evolves. 4D-STEM mapping provided nanometer spatial resolution of the full 2D strain tensor, offering new insights into the internal structure and phase transformations of these nanoparticles.

- **Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography for label-free 3D imaging of biological samples and correlate it with electron array tomography.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography, which translates subtle refractive index (RI) changes into color for label-free visualization of tissue microstructure. This optical method was correlated with electron array tomography of the same resin-embedded sample, enabling axially super-resolved label-free imaging of whole cells in the range of 30-200 nm. This approach shows great potential for multimodal 3D colorimetric histology at the (sub-)organelle level. Electron array tomography was used for correlative imaging, providing a benchmark for the plasmon-enhanced optical technique.

- **Authors**: Jiesen Guo, Fan Yang, Yuzhou He, Xinyang Liu, Zheng Deng, Qinghua Zhang, Xiancheng Wang, Xianlei Sheng, Wei Li, Changqing Jin, Kan Zhao
- **Date**: 2025-07-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in the metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal.
- **Finding**: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms, while scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting ZnP bond instability. Magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ and heat capacity measurements confirmed long-range A-type antiferromagnetic order at $T_N = 4.5$ K. Despite density functional theory predicting an indirect semiconductor, the single crystal exhibited metallic conductivity with an anomaly at $T_N$, likely associated with the observed interstitial P atoms. STEM was crucial for identifying the interstitial P atoms and their arrangement, which influences the material's electronic properties.

- **Objective**: To characterize and quantify Zn incorporation in CuInS$_2$ quantum dots (QDs) using element-specific X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and time-resolved optical spectroscopies to understand its role in structural modification and surface passivation.
- **Finding**: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), precisely detected the formation of a ZnS surface shell and resolved the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent or an interstitial defect. Time-resolved optical spectroscopies provided deeper insights into the optical and dynamical properties of the QDs, revealing the effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer.

- **Date**: 2025-07-13
- **Objective**: To correlate the synthesis conditions, structural properties, and thermal stability of Bi-doped copper (Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$) nanowires, promising candidates for spintronic applications, using electron microscopy and in situ scattering methods.
- **Finding**: Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ nanowires with varying Bi content and crystalline domain sizes were fabricated via template-assisted electrodeposition. Advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed that synthesis conditions influenced crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or at grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. NWs with larger crystalline domains showed homogeneous Bi incorporation, while smaller domains exhibited noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. Variable temperature X-ray diffraction showed lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice upon heating. These findings establish a basis for optimizing spin Hall effect performance by linking synthesis to microstructural features and thermal behavior.

- **Date**: 2025-07-12
- **Objective**: To develop a three-step molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) process for growing high-quality, optically uniform WSe$_2$ monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).
- **Finding**: A three-step MBE process was optimized to maximize photoluminescence efficiency and promote hexagonal WSe$_2$ domain formation on hBN. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) estimated the dispersion of WSe$_2$ hexagonal domain orientation. The monolayer character of the film was identified using optical methods and verified with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section. Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent studies revealed exciton complex behavior analogous to exfoliated counterparts. This direct growth method on hBN, combined with uniform optical response, proves superior convenience and reproducibility compared to mechanical exfoliation, marking significant progress in the optical quality of epitaxially grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) monolayers.
