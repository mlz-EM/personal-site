**1. [Unexpected Anisotropic Mn-Sb Anti-site Distribution and Van der Waals Epitaxy of MnSb2Te4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11353v1)
- **Authors**: Gustavo Chavez Ponce de Leon, Ahmad Dibajeh, Gert ten Brink, Majid Ahmadi, Bart Jan Kooi, George Palasantzas
- **Date**: 2026-01-16
- **Objective**: To investigate the distribution of Mn-Sb anti-site defects in $\mathrm{MnSb}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{4}$ and establish a method for growing thin films for Si-based integration.

**4. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties in ultrathin $\mathrm{Si}/\mathrm{Fe}$ bilayers as a function of Fe layer thickness, focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed a percolation-driven transition in microstructure from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure of grains when the Fe layer thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Fe}}$) drops below 30 Å. This structural evolution leads to a clear divergence in magnetotransport properties and a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism from mixed intrinsic/side-jump to skew-scattering dominant in high-resistive films ($t_{\mathrm{Fe}} \le 30$ Å).

**11. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09

- **Finding**: A pronounced, non-monotonic enhancement of the Anomalous Ettingshausen effect was observed in the atomic-heterogeneity regime before full crystallization. Structural analyses using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed that this enhancement is due to subtle structural heterogeneity, specifically the formation of Fe-based crystalline alloys and Cu nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix.

- **Finding**: The electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic ($SmA-N$) and nematic to isotropic ($N-I$). Kinetic dependence on dose rate suggests that the phenomena are mainly thermal in nature, caused by substantial heat generation. Spontaneous formation of disclinations and complete process reversibility were reported.

**30. [Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $SrVO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843v1)**
- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a direct and controllable approach for recovering the intrinsic correlated-metallic $V^{4+}$ surface character of $SrVO_{3}$ (SVO) by thermally reducing the oxidized near-surface region (NSR) under ultra-high vacuum.
- **Finding**: Real-time *in situ* X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed a sharp transformation from a $V^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states dominated by $V^{4+}$. Ex-situ characterization suggested the transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution, partial oxygen loss, and nanoscale surface reorganization, pointing toward a predominantly structural surface reorganization rather than $V_{2}O_{5}$ volatilization.
- **EM Contribution**: High-resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR-SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the surface morphology, suggesting that the thermal reduction process leads to nanoscale surface reorganization.
