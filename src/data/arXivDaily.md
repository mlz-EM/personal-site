- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate how a scandium nitride (ScN) buffer layer affects the superconducting properties of thin niobium nitride (NbN) films.
- **Finding**: The ScN buffer layer significantly enhanced the superconducting characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films, increasing the critical temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ from 9 K to 12.5 K and decreasing resistivity. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirmed that these improvements stem from better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, leading to a higher quality NbN crystal lattice.

**3. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: To report and investigate a pronounced, room-temperature magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in classic ferroelectric materials $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$.

This collective spin ordering transforms the defects into a magnetically responsive platform, achieving an EO efficiency up to 34 pm/V. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) directly visualized the magnetic-field-induced formation of these room-temperature skyrmion states.

- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of temperature on ferroelastic domain wall (DW) behavior across different thickness regimes in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: A distinct interplay between temperature and thickness was identified: DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) are mobile near $T_C$ and freeze upon cooling, while DWs in the crossover regime (200-300 nm) are nearly static. In situ heating Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), combined with machine-learning analysis, was used to track DW curvature and density, mapping the evolution across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes.

- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform direct real-space imaging of nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ using Fresnel Lorentz TEM and to understand the limitations of conventional chiral discrimination methods for ultrasmall skyrmions.
- **Finding**: Conventional analysis led to an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon. Systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations attributed this misinterpretation to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function (CTF). Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) in Fresnel mode, supported by off-axis electron holography, was crucial for imaging and establishing quantitative limitations for nanoscale magnetic imaging of ultrasmall skyrmions.

- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet and determine the origin of its topological-Hall-like resistivity anomalies.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed but showed little correlation with magnetic transitions, suggesting a trivial origin likely due to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) measurements were essential, definitively ruling out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet.

- **Finding**: Calculations showed that while $K_{\text{u}}$ is 4.2 $\text{MJ/m}^3$ under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain, highlighting the detrimental effect of lattice distortion. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was used to characterize the fabricated alloys, revealing the presence of significant compressive strain (up to 25%) near grain boundaries.

- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study how the phase factor ($\phi_0$) controls the magnetic textures, specifically Surface Spirals (SS), at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) in chiral magnets.
- **Finding**: $\phi_0$ is established as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, governing the presence, shape, and topological charge of surface spirals adjacent to FCIs.

- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_{\text{c}}$) above 60 K in epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset reached $\sim 63$ K, achieved through extreme non-equilibrium growth (GAE method). The films showed a systematic evolution from Fermi-liquid-like to strange-metal-like behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$) at higher $T_{\text{c}}$, and exhibited significantly stronger interlayer coupling than cuprates. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), combined with synchrotron XRD, confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity and high quality of the strained films, which is essential for stabilizing this metastable high-$T_{\text{c}}$ phase.

The Co spin state is governed by the interfacial environment, with a $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer resulting in a Co $d^6$ low spin state. High-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed a clear connection between strain at the oxide interfaces and the resulting spin configuration, emphasizing the importance of structural control for spin engineering.

**23. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters—probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism—on the accuracy of atomic-resolution Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) measurements in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations showed that instrumental misalignments, particularly defocus and astigmatism, significantly compromise measurement accuracy, leading to electrostatic field magnitude underestimation by up to 30% or more depending on the probe and defocus magnitude. The analysis confirms the sensitivity and usefulness of the scattergram-based DPC-STEM method but underscores the critical need for optimized instrumental alignment for accurate CoM-based imaging.

- **Finding**: The CsCl seed layer successfully fosters organic precursor incorporation across the $\text{MeO}-2\text{PACz/perovskite}$ interface, preventing the formation of residual $\text{PbI}_2$ and leading to larger apparent perovskite grains. EM Contribution: X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) revealed the mechanism of improved precursor incorporation. This resulted in a high-efficiency tandem solar cell achieving $30.3\%$ (29.7% certified) efficiency.

**29. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize "e-coherent" crystalline interfaces, where coherency is enhanced by local, non-affine relaxations (termed discohesions), extending beyond traditional models based only on affine transformations.
- **Finding**: E-coherent interfaces achieve additional coincidence sites through non-affine transformations, topologically equivalent to inserting disconnection dipoles or loops (discohesions). These discohesions lack long-range stress fields and fundamentally alter the energetics and kinetics of grain, twin, and phase boundaries. EM Contribution: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), combined with atomistic simulations, was used to demonstrate the existence of e-coherency and characterize the content and effects of discohesions within various crystalline interfaces.

- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce an electron linear dichroism (ELD) methodology in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) capable of probing electronic anisotropies and orbital polarization with atomic resolution, overcoming the spatial limits of X-ray techniques.
- **Finding**: By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in STEM, the $\text{Mn}-3\text{d}$ $\text{e}_\text{g}$ orbital polarization was directly visualized with sub-angstrom precision in strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_3$ thin films. Compressive strain stabilizes $3\text{z}^2-\text{r}^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $\text{x}^2-\text{y}^2$. EM Contribution: The core achievement is the development and validation of the STEM-EELS ELD methodology, which provides the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity required to resolve orbital occupation in real space.

- **Authors**: Ana Senkić, Rachael Keneipp, Petra Ivatović, Namrata Pradeep, Vincent Meunier, Marko Kralj, Marija Drndić, Nataša Vujičić
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and characterize a structural phase transition induced by tungsten (W) doping in bilayer ($\text{2L}$) $\text{MoS}_2$ synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
- **Finding**: Increasing W concentration induces a phase transition from the non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to the centrosymmetric $\text{AB}'$ stacking in $\text{2L}$ $\text{MoS}_2$. This transition is confirmed by a vanishing polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) signal and a stiffening of the layer-breathing (LB) vibrational mode. EM Contribution: Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) was employed to map the spatial distribution of W concentration and directly visualize the associated structural changes within the $\text{MoS}_2$ bilayers.

- **Finding**: Twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, particularly the out-of-plane $\text{A}_{1\text{g}}$ mode of $\text{Bi/Sr}$ at $116\ \text{cm}^{-1}$, provide clear optical fingerprints that reliably quantify the rotational misalignment between cuprate layers. EM Contribution: The study highlights that conventional characterization tools like electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques can damage the highly unstable twisted interface, emphasizing the necessity and advantage of the proposed non-invasive optical method.

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the Nernst and Hall effects in $\text{Fe}_{4-\text{x}}\text{Ge}_\text{x}\text{N}$ thin films to study the enhancement of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) and its relationship with structural anisotropy.
- **Finding**: Tetragonal samples ($x=0.8$ and $x=1$) display an unusual two-component behavior in their Hall and Nernst hysteresis loops. This is caused by the co-existence of two crystallographic orientations (c-axis and a-axis normal to the film) combined with opposite signs of the anomalous effects for magnetization along the a- and c-axes. Maximum ANE was $0.9\ \mu\text{V/K}$ for $x=0$. EM Contribution: Electron microscopy experiments were performed to characterize the crystalline structure, confirming the cubic symmetry of $\text{Fe}_4\text{N}$ and the tetragonal distortion for $x>0.35$.

- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Objective**: To investigate how the substrate miscut angle of c-plane sapphire affects the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting transition temperature ($\text{T}_\text{c}$) of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown niobium nitride ($\text{NbN}$) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle (up to $10^\text{o}$) significantly improved the structural quality of the $\text{NbN}$ films (FWHM reduced from $76\ \text{arcsecs}$ to $20\ \text{arcsecs}$). The critical thickness for columnar growth was found to be consistently around $10\ \text{nm}$, regardless of miscut. Improved structural quality correlated with a marginal increase in $\text{T}_\text{c}$ (from $12.1\ \text{K}$ to $12.5\ \text{K}$). EM Contribution: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were essential for determining the critical thickness (around $10\ \text{nm}$) at which the $\text{NbN}$ film structure transitions to columnar growth.

- **Objective**: To develop a data-efficient deep learning pipeline using a lightweight U-Net for the rapid, automated, and accurate segmentation of carbide precipitates in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of steel alloys.
- **Finding**: A lightweight U-Net trained on only 10 annotated SEM images achieved a Dice-Sørensen coefficient of $0.98$, substantially outperforming classical image analysis methods ($0.85$). This demonstrates a significant reduction in annotation effort while providing highly accurate segmentation necessary for carbide quantification and alloy design. EM Contribution: The entire methodology is built upon processing and analyzing microstructural data acquired specifically via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.

- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism by which edge dislocation glide begins to control strength in refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) at elevated temperatures, leading to enhanced mechanical performance.
- **Finding**: In the $\text{Nb}-\text{Ta}-\text{Ti}-\text{V}$ system, increasing V content induces substantial atomic misfit, which selectively raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual mechanistic transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, resulting in markedly enhanced strength at high temperatures. EM Contribution: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used in conjunction with mechanical testing and simulations to characterize the dislocation mechanisms and structural changes responsible for the transition in deformation control.

- **Objective**: To strategically exploit the metastability of carbon-doped Cantor alloy-based amorphous high-entropy nanoalloys (HEANPs) via post-synthesis annealing to enhance their electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
- **Finding**: Annealing the amorphous HEANPs at $600^\text{o}\text{C}$ induces crystallization and elemental partitioning, resulting in heterostructured nanoparticles encased in reinforced carbon shells. This structural transformation led to a 5- to 7-fold enhancement in electrocatalytic activity for the OER compared to the as-synthesized amorphous state. EM Contribution: In situ electron microscopy was critical for directly observing the crystallization and elemental partitioning processes that occur upon heating, confirming the strategic control of phase metastability.

- **Objective**: To examine the complex sequence of solid-state phase transformations occurring in the metastable $\beta\ \text{Zr}15\text{Nb}$ alloy during linear heating using combined in-situ and ex-situ techniques.
- **Finding**: The room-temperature microstructure ($\beta_{\text{Zr}} + \omega_{\text{ath}}$) decomposes upon heating, with $\beta_{\text{Zr}}$ giving rise to $\beta_{\text{Nb}}$. The $\omega$ solvus temperature was determined to be approximately $555^\text{o}\text{C}$. The growth of the $\alpha$ phase occurs only after the dissolution of the $\omega$ phase. EM Contribution: Ex-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations revealed the cuboidal shape of the $\omega_{\text{iso}}$ particles, which is a result of the high lattice misfit between the $\beta$ and $\omega$ phases.

- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To use high-resolution electron microscopy and spectroscopy to resolve band gap variations across $\kappa-\text{Ga}_2\text{O}_3$-based multilayers and decouple the effects of interfacial strain and composition on electronic properties.
- **Finding**: Using an automated quantitative analysis framework, reliable band gap excitations were extracted from nanometer-thick layers. For heterostructures on ITO, strain at defect-free interfaces induced a gradual band gap transition (from $5.08\ \text{eV}$ to $4.28\ \text{eV}$) over $\sim 10\ \text{nm}$, dominating over the abrupt compositional change. On ZnO templates, defects relieved strain, resulting in band gaps consistent with composition. EM Contribution: Monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) was the crucial tool for achieving nanometer-scale precision in mapping and quantifying band gap variations.
