- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: Investigate the structural, magnetic, and topological spin texture properties of the layered compound Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ to understand the origin of N\'{e}el skyrmions in a centrosymmetric material and its magnetic ground state.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques revealed that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking despite global inversion symmetry, providing a convincing explanation for the presence of N\'{e;el} skyrmions observed via Lorentz-TEM. Thermodynamic measurements and neutron diffraction further indicated a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, not a glassy state, with a clear correlation between skyrmion density hysteresis and magnetization, suggesting topological spin textures are affected by ferrimagnetism. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) also showed magnetic bubbles at phase boundaries, implying skyrmions are stabilized by competing magnetic phases and exchange interactions.

- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: Revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data and identify new imaging modes, including approximations to ptychography.
- **Finding**: The study generalizes phase contrast theory to 4D-STEM, showing that tilt correction and summation of symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk (tcBF and tcDPC) enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximizes information use under the weak phase object approximation. Beyond this, it identifies contrast transfer from inelastic/plural scattering, which can be enhanced under overfocus conditions, and demonstrates a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) for depth sectioning of strong scatterers, providing analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography.

Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: Investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps.
- **Finding**: X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses revealed that processing steps like pressing and heat treatment significantly influence supercrystalline defects. Pressing distorted the fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yielded supraparticles with stacking faults. Crucially, heat treatment, also used for organic crosslinking, caused stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes. In-situ STEM provided direct observations of these defect rearrangements at the tens-of-nanometer scale, offering new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered nanoparticle assemblies.

- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: Directly image the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation to understand ultrafast magnetic control.
- **Finding**: Using Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation, the study directly imaged the rapid evolution of disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state, in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. In a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs formed and spontaneously vanished within picoseconds. Multiscale simulations revealed a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs, explaining the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering and establishing a framework for femtosecond control of spin textures.

- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: Propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware metric for assessing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, moving beyond the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) is a more accurate, dose-aware metric for evaluating STEM phase retrieval compared to the CTF, which neglects finite electron fluence and Poisson-limited detection. Using numerical reconstructions, it showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs with analytic expressions, while iterative ptychography shows a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds. This work highlights the critical role of dose-aware metrics for practical STEM performance assessment.

This setup provided a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition when excited with an azimuthally polarized beam compared to other beams, offering new opportunities for spectroscopy of forbidden transitions. While the abstract mentions "nanoscale sample engineering," it does not explicitly detail the use of electron microscopy techniques for the reported findings.

- **Finding**: Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in plan-view orientation on an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film, the study experimentally observed strikingly non-uniform dipole organization within irreducibly narrow polar layers. This revealed atomically thin, dimensionally confined, strongly charged 180-degree domain walls, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, each with distinctive interfacial structures and confining in-plane domains to a sub-$nm^2$ footprint. This represents the first observation of antipolar ferroic ordering nested within self-organized polar nonpolar layering, revealing novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale.

- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: Investigate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions, specifically focusing on how repeated laser irradiation alters nucleation pathways in FeRh thin films.
- **Finding**: Using the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ transmission electron microscopy, the study observed that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films. This caused a switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation, a 20 K decrease in transition temperature, and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned by underlying dislocation networks. The in situ TEM allowed direct observation of dislocation network formation and rearrangement upon repeated phase transition crossings, establishing a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the crystallinity of the thin films, confirming that the enhanced NLMR was achieved while maintaining crystallinity. This work demonstrates high-energy ion implantation as a practical route for realizing chiralitronic functionalities in topological semimetals.

- **Finding**: The study introduced MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model integrated as a generative prior into existing iterative solvers for multislice electron ptychography (MEP) via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). This hybrid approach significantly enhanced the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes of atomic crystal structures, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods. This demonstrates how advanced computational techniques, like generative priors, can overcome the ill-posed nature of inverse imaging problems in electron ptychography, leading to higher-resolution and more accurate reconstructions from diffraction patterns.
