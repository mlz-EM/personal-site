- **Objective**: Determine the atomic and electronic structure of strongly charged domain walls (DWs) in the van der Waals ferroelectric $\alpha\text{-In}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$ using atomic resolution imaging and first principles calculations.
- **Finding**: **Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** showed that head-to-head (HH) DWs incorporate a layer of nonpolar $\beta\text{-In}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$, while tail-to-tail (TT) DWs are atomically abrupt. Furthermore, **4D STEM** and **multislice electron ptychography** were used to map domains in 2D and 3D, revealing complex, curved DW structures. Band structure calculations predict localized conducting states within a $\sim 1 \text{ nm}$ layer at both HH and TT DWs.

**30. [Nanoparticle Self-assembly Assisted by Polymers: The Role of Shear Stress in the Nanoparticle Arrangement of Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13842v1)**
- **Authors**: Beatriz Martín-García, M. Mercedes Velázquez
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To investigate how shear stress, induced by compression-expansion cycles, influences the self-assembly and arrangement of $\text{CdSe}$ quantum dots ($\text{QDs}$) within mixed Langmuir-Blodgett ($\text{LB}$) films assisted by a block copolymer.
- **Finding**: Shear stress promoted a new equilibrium state in the Langmuir monolayer, leading to more ordered $\text{LB}$ films. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) measurements of the transferred films showed that increasing the amplitude strain decreased the $\text{QDs}$ domain size and resulted in a more ordered morphology.

- **Authors**: Miran Joo, Huixin Xiu, Sabrina Baha, Ridha Zerdoumi, Ningyan Cheng, Christoph Somsen, Yujiao Li, Aleksander Kostka, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Alfred Ludwig, Christina Scheu
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To correlate the Ruthenium ($\text{Ru}$) content with microstructural defects, local chemistry, and electrocatalytic activity (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, $\text{HER}$) in $\text{Au-Pd-Pt-Ru}$ compositionally complex solid solution ($\text{CCSS}$) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing $\text{Ru}$ content caused lattice contraction and a microstructural transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults. Electron microscopy equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy ($\text{EDX}$) confirmed composition, and Atom Probe Tomography ($\text{APT}$) revealed local compositional fluctuations (enrichment/depletion) at grain boundaries.

**32. [Near-atomic investigation on the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nano-sized kappa phase and B2 phase in an Al-alloyed lightweight steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13721v1)**
- **Authors**: Bowen Zou, Yixu Wang, Xiao Shen, Philipp Krooss, Thomas Niendorf, Richard Dronskowski, Wenwen Song
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To reveal the elemental redistribution mechanisms during the co-precipitation of nanosized $\kappa$ and $B2$ phases in an $\text{Al}$-alloyed lightweight steel using correlative microscopy and simulation.
- **Finding**: Two co-nanoprecipitation modes were observed. Correlative Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{TKD-TEM}$) and Atom Probe Tomography ($\text{APT}$) showed that $B2$ precipitates next to $\kappa$ (B2I) were $\text{FeAl}$-type, while isolated $B2$ (B2II) were $\text{NiAl}$-type. $\text{APT}$ provided near-atomic resolution confirmation that $\text{Fe-Ni}$ atomic exchange between the phases is thermodynamically favorable, driving the stability of the co-precipitates.

- **Authors**: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2026-01-19

**42. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and microstructural evolution near the percolation threshold in ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ bilayers and correlate these changes with their magnetic and magnetotransport properties.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{HRTEM}$) revealed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure of grains when the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) dropped below $30\text{ \AA}$. This structural evolution drives a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect ($\text{AHE}$) mechanism, transitioning from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution in thick films to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism in the high-resistive, percolative films.

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To definitively determine the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ thin films, a promising candidate for altermagnetism, using X-ray linear dichroism ($\text{XLD}$).
- **Finding**: The observed $\text{XLD}$ signal was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field, strongly suggesting a nonmagnetic origin for $\text{RuO}_2$, in contrast to theoretical predictions of magnetic order. While $\text{XLD}$ is the primary technique, this work establishes a robust method for probing low-symmetry magnetic materials, complementing structural characterization often provided by electron microscopy.

**49. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\alpha-\text{Mn}$ precipitate size in an ultrafine-grained $\text{Mg-Mn}$ alloy during room temperature high-pressure torsion ($\text{HPT}$).
- **Finding**: Although the volume fraction of $\text{nm}$-scale $\alpha-\text{Mn}$ particles increased with applied strain, Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{STEM}$) analysis of the precipitate size distribution determined that the mean particle size did not increase over the course of $\text{HPT}$. This finding suggests that precipitate growth under these extreme plastic deformation conditions is subject to interfacial control rather than diffusional control.

- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To quantify the influence of residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity, arising from virtual substrate ($\text{VS}$) growth, on the interface structure and variability of $\text{SiGe}$ quantum dots used for spin qubits.
- **Finding**: Spatially-aligned images of strain (Raman microscopy) and interface structure (Atomic Force Microscopy ($\text{AFM}$) and cross-sectional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{STEM}$)) revealed a strong strain-roughness interplay. $\text{AFM}$ and $\text{STEM}$ confirmed interface roughness, which modeling showed modestly reduces valley splitting. The results highlight the need for optimized $\text{VS}$ buffer layers and lower growth temperatures ($\text{T} \le 700\text{ }^{\circ}\text{C}$) to minimize strain-induced roughening.
