In contrast, $\text{Ar}$ irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, leading to highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces and strongly affecting the electrical properties, particularly in the $\text{Au} + \text{C}_{60}$ system. Irradiation-induced morphological changes were systematically examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

- **Finding**: Shear stress successfully moved nanoparticles out of metastable states, promoting a new equilibrium state in the Langmuir monolayer, where increasing strain amplitude resulted in smaller $\text{QD}$ domains and more ordered $\text{LB}$ films. The resulting morphology of the $\text{LB}$ films transferred onto mica was analyzed and confirmed using Atomic Force Microscopy ($\text{AFM}$) and Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{TEM}$) measurements.

- **Objective**: To reveal the elemental redistribution mechanisms during the co-precipitation of nanosized $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ phases within the $\text{FCC}$ matrix of an $\text{Al}$-alloyed lightweight steel.
- **Finding**: Two co-nanoprecipitation modes were observed: $\text{B}2$ forming with $\kappa$ ($\text{B}2_{\text{I}}$, $\text{FeAl}$ type) and $\text{B}2$ forming separately ($\text{B}2_{\text{II}}$, $\text{NiAl}$ type). Correlative Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{TKD-TEM}$) measurements were used to identify the precipitation modes, while Atom Probe Tomography ($\text{APT}$) provided near-atomic resolution confirmation of the distinct elemental compositions, showing that $\text{Fe-Ni}$ atomic exchange drives the $\text{B}2$ phase evolution toward greater stability.

- **Finding**: The $\text{SPS}$ ceramics exhibited colossal relative dielectric permittivity, reaching values of $10^5 - 10^6$, with conduction determined by the Mott variable range hopping mechanism. Scanning Electron Microscopy ($\text{SEM}$) was utilized to estimate the concentration and distribution of carbon impurity within the samples, establishing a correlation where larger carbon concentration resulted in smaller permittivity and resistivity in the Mott conduction range.

**22. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar

- **Objective**: To analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in $\text{Si/Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) is varied, focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: A percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure was observed when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ decreased below $30 \text{ \AA}$. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{HRTEM}$) data confirmed this structural evolution, which coincided with a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect ($\text{AHE}$) mechanism from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism in the high-resistive films.

Photoemission Electron Microscopy ($\text{PEEM}$) was utilized in conjunction with $\text{XLD}$ measurements to characterize the films, establishing $\text{XLD}$ as a robust technique for probing low-symmetry magnetic materials.

**29. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
