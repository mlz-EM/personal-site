- **Authors**: Marc Raventós-Tato, S. Leila Panahi, Núria Bagués, David Frómeta, Oleg Usoltsev, Núria Cuadrado, Joaquín Otón
- **Date**: 2026-01-29
- **Objective**: To map the coupled evolution of chemistry and crystallography at the nanoscale during phase transformation in medium-manganese TRIP steel.
- **Finding**: A correlative scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) approach, combining nano-beam electron diffraction (NBED) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), achieved simultaneous mapping of lattice structure, orientation, and phase distribution at $10 \text{ nm}$ resolution. This multimodal workflow quantified phase fractions and lattice parameters, revealing measurable shifts in grain-size distributions and systematically lower local misorientation (Kernel Average Misorientation maps) in ferrite than in martensite.

**2. [Interfacial Coupling Controls Molecular Epitaxy of HMTP on Graphene/SiC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22263v1)**
- **Authors**: Devanshu Varshney, Pavel Procházka, Veronika Stará, Mykhailo Shestopalov, Jan Kunc, Jiří Novák, Jan Čechal
- **Date**: 2026-01-29
- **Objective**: To track the ordering and epitaxial growth of the molecular donor HMTP on heterogeneous graphene/SiC substrates and determine the influence of interfacial coupling.
- **Finding**: HMTP forms highly ordered epitaxial layers on single-layer graphene but results in amorphous/polycrystalline films on the covalently bound buffer layer residuals. Hydrogen intercalation successfully decoupled the buffer layer, converting it into quasi-freestanding graphene and restoring epitaxial growth. Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and diffraction were crucial for tracking the molecular ordering from the first layer to thin films.

- **Objective**: To investigate how absorbed hydrogen influences the electronic and magneto-structural properties of $\text{X}2\text{Cr}\text{Ni}18-9$ stainless steel in different microstructural states.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen incorporation induced clear changes in the Seebeck coefficients. Magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) indicated the existence of nanoscale inhomogeneities (fcc structure, correlation lengths of a few nanometers) whose size increased with hydrogen incorporation, suggesting hydrogen preferentially accumulates in their vicinity. Analytic electron microscopy mapping was used to characterize the microstructure, including grain size and chemical homogeneity.

- **Date**: 2026-01-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a one-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattice formed in twisted bilayer $1T'-\text{WTe}_2$.
- **Finding**: Lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moiré stripes, matching experimental observations from high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The relaxed structure hosts quasi-1D electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction. These 1D electronic states are primarily governed by an intralayer moiré potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than interlayer hybridization.

- **Authors**: Maciej W. Olszewski, Lingda Kong, Simon Reinhardt, Daniel Tong, Xinyi Du, Gabriele Di Gianluca, Haoran Lu, Saswata Roy, Luojia Zhang, Aleksandra B. Biedron, David A. Muller, Valla Fatemi
- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To synthesize high-quality body-centered cubic ($\alpha$-Ta) superconducting thin films at low temperatures compatible with scalable semiconductor fabrication by modifying the sputter gas.
- **Finding**: Using krypton (Kr) instead of argon (Ar) as the sputter gas promoted BCC ($\alpha$-Ta) synthesis on silicon at temperatures as low as $200^\circ\text{C}$. These films exhibited high electronic conductivity and state-of-the-art microwave performance. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that higher microwave losses in films grown at higher temperatures correlated directly with increased $\text{Ta}/\text{Si}$ intermixing.

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To investigate the formation and stability of heterogeneous lanthanide-ion clusters in $\text{Yb}^{3+}/\text{Ln}^{3+}$ co-doped $\text{CaF}_2$ nanoparticles, correlating experimental spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the morphological properties of the synthesized nanoparticles. DFT calculations showed that the relative concentration of neutral $C_{4v}$ aggregations containing $\text{Ln}^{3+}$ decreases across the lanthanide series, matching experimental spectroscopic variations. This provides insight into clustering mechanisms critical for optimizing luminescence.

- **Objective**: To investigate the metastability of topologically protected magnetic textures (skyrmions) in (Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$)$_{5}\text{Ge}\text{Te}_{2}$ (FCGT) by mapping zero-field magnetic states created via field-cooling protocols.
- **Finding**: In-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) was used under controlled temperature and magnetic field to map the resulting meta(stable) zero-field magnetic states. This allowed the construction of a phase diagram detailing the zero-field metastable spin structures in FCGT, which is essential for future manipulation studies using external stimuli.

- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To determine the atomic and electronic structure of strongly charged domain walls in the van der Waals ferroelectric $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$.
- **Finding**: Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) showed that head-to-head (HH) domain walls contain a layer of nonpolar $\beta$-In$_2$Se$_3$, while tail-to-tail (TT) walls are atomically abrupt. Furthermore, 4D STEM and multislice electron ptychography revealed complex, curved 3D structures for nearly $180^\circ$ domain walls. DFT calculations confirmed localized conducting states, such as a midgap state at the $\beta$ layer, within a $\sim 1 \text{ nm}$ thick layer at both HH and TT walls.

- **Authors**: Utkarsh Pratiush, Austin Houston, Richard Liu, Gerd Duscher, Sergei Kalinin
- **Date**: 2026-01-26
- **Objective**: To introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient, and robust tuning of aberration coefficients in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The MOBO framework utilizes Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape, enabling active learning that selects the most informative lens settings, proving more robust than traditional search algorithms. By generating Pareto fronts, it balances competing objectives (e.g., focus and astigmatism), facilitating "self-optimizing" microscopy that dynamically sustains optimal performance during high-throughput STEM experiments.

- **Date**: 2026-01-25
- **Objective**: To develop a dose-efficient, self-correcting residual neural field framework for ptychography applicable across electron, X-ray, and optical modalities.
- **Finding**: The complex-valued architecture reformulates reconstruction as residual learning, where the network learns corrections to physical priors, improving convergence and reducing data redundancy. By embedding the physical model, end-to-end automatic differentiation allows joint correction of experimental parameters. The framework demonstrated superior performance in revealing synaptic connectivity in brain sections using electron wavelengths, providing a solution for high-throughput, dose-efficient nanoscopy.

- **Authors**: Serin Lee, Stephanie M. Ribet, Arthur R. C. McCray, Andrew Barnum, Jennifer A. Dionne, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2026-01-24
- **Objective**: To introduce a scalable, unsupervised clustering algorithm for efficient processing and segmentation of high-dimensional 4D-STEM and 5D-STEM data based on local crystallographic similarity.
- **Finding**: The framework identifies crystallographically distinct domains by clustering based on local diffraction-pattern similarity, extracting closed contours that delineate regions of coherent structural behavior. This method significantly compresses data volume and improves signal-to-noise, enabling rapid and accurate orientation, phase, and strain mapping, demonstrated successfully on *in situ* liquid-cell 4D-STEM data of gold nanoparticle growth.

**16. [Role of defects in the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases at asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16611v1)**
- **Authors**: Swetha Pemma, Lena Langenohl, Saba Saood, Yoonji Choi, Rebecca Janisch, Christian H. Liebscher, Gerhard Dehm, Tobias Brink
- **Date**: 2026-01-23
- **Objective**: To investigate how geometrically necessary defects (disconnections) influence the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases (complexions) at inclined, asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper.
- **Finding**: Combining molecular dynamics simulations and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments on $\Sigma 37c$ $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt boundaries in $\text{Cu}$ revealed that defect energies have a major influence on grain boundary phase stability, even at small inclinations. When large inclinations cannot be accommodated by defects, the defective asymmetric phases compete with grain boundary faceting. STEM was used to analyze the atomic structure and characterize the disconnections in experimental $\text{Cu}$ and $\text{Al}$ samples.

- **Date**: 2026-01-23
- **Objective**: To mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur ($\text{Li}-\text{S}$) batteries by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with synergistic ferromagnetic ($\text{Ni}$, $\text{Co}$) and solid-state ionic ($\text{LAGP}$) coatings.
- **Finding**: $\text{LAGP}$-based coatings significantly enhanced separator stability and suppressed polysulfide diffusion. The combined $\text{LAGP}/\text{Co}$ architecture provided the most effective suppression, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the surface morphology and elemental composition of the modified separators.

- **Authors**: Jehyeok Ryu, Victor Krivenkov, Vitaly Goryashko, Yury Rakovich, Alexey Y. Nikitin
- **Date**: 2026-01-22
- **Objective**: To develop a methodology for reconstructing the intrinsic size-dependent complex dielectric permittivity of individual perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) from ensemble absorbance spectra.
- **Finding**: The permittivity of $\text{CsPbBr}_3$ PNCs was successfully reconstructed by modeling the exciton transition energies based on effective mass and incorporating the size distribution obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) into the Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. The extracted spectral linewidth ($78.4 \text{ meV}$) was consistent with single nanocrystal emission, validating the approach.

**19. [Effects of pulsed and continuous light and heavy ion irradiation on the morphology and electrical properties of Ag+C60 and Au+C60 composite thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15835v1)**
- **Authors**: Giovanni Ceccio, Kazumasa Takahashi, Yuto Kondo, Romana Miksova, Vasily Lavrentiev, Josef Novak, Eva Stepanovska, Jiri Vacik
- **Date**: 2026-01-22
- **Objective**: To investigate the differential effects of continuous $\text{Ar}$ ion irradiation versus pulsed $\text{C}$ ion irradiation on the morphology and electrical properties of $\text{Ag}+\text{C}_{60}$ and $\text{Au}+\text{C}_{60}$ nanocomposite thin films.
- **Finding**: $\text{C}$-irradiated films retained compact, homogeneous surfaces and showed minor resistivity changes. In contrast, $\text{Ar}$ irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, resulting in highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces, which strongly affected the electrical resistance, particularly in the $\text{Au}+\text{C}_{60}$ system. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine these irradiation-induced morphological changes.

- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To obtain and characterize thin films of reduced graphite oxide (RGO) functionalized with the zwitterionic surfactant $\text{DDPS}$ using the Langmuir-Blodgett method.
- **Finding**: Functionalization of RGO with $\text{DDPS}$ improved the degrees of reduction and defect repair achieved by chemical reducing agents (hydrazine or vitamin C), leading to a significant increase in the electrical conductivity of the resulting paper-like films. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to verify the quality and morphology of the RGO sheets.

- **Authors**: Alyssa Ang De Guzman, Anish Mathai Varghese, Saif Alshalloudi, Lance Kosca, Kyriaki Polychronopoulou, Marko Gacesa
- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To validate and characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants representing lunar highlands and the south pole to assess their oxygen extractability for in situ resource utilization (ISRU).
- **Finding**: The simulants demonstrated strong mineralogical and compositional fidelity to returned lunar samples. Although ilmenite is the most readily reducible phase, bulk highland simulants showed favorable reduction behavior due to distributed $\text{Fe}$-bearing silicate and glassy phases. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) was used to confirm the mineralogical heterogeneity and elemental composition.

- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and characterize the emergence of ferroelectricity above room temperature in bulk-cubic $\text{KTaO}_3$ thin films induced by epitaxial strain.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial strain of $-2.1\%$ transformed the $\text{KTaO}_3$ structure into a tetragonal polar phase with a transition temperature of $475 \text{ K}$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns relative to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature, confirming the emergence of a robust intrinsic ferroelectric state.

- **Authors**: Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Wei Lv, Xianfeng Wu, Guangdi Zhou, Zihao Nie, Yueying Li, Cui Ding, Danfeng Li, Hongtao Yuan, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To achieve continuous and ultrawide-range control over the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in infinite-layer nickelates using an *operando* monitored reduction (OMR) method.
- **Finding**: OMR enabled the continuous modulation of the $\text{Ni}$ $3d$ orbital electron occupancy from $\sim 3d^7$ to $\sim 3d^9$. The occupancy was calibrated using synchrotron X-ray absorption combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms. Angle-dependent magnetotransport suggested a mixed two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) superconducting character, deviating from the canonical 2D model.

**24. [Nanoparticle Self-assembly Assisted by Polymers: The Role of Shear Stress in the Nanoparticle Arrangement of Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13842v1)**
- **Authors**: Beatriz Martín-García, M. Mercedes Velázquez
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To investigate how shear stress (via compression-expansion cycles) influences the self-assembly and arrangement of $\text{CdSe}$ quantum dots (QDs) in polymer-assisted Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films.
- **Finding**: Shear stress applied through 50 compression-expansion cycles removed QDs from metastable states at the air-water interface, promoting a more ordered equilibrium state. Increasing the amplitude strain led to a decrease in QD domain size and increased order in the transferred LB film. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to analyze the resulting morphology of the LB films.

- **Authors**: Miran Joo, Huixin Xiu, Sabrina Baha, Ridha Zerdoumi, Ningyan Cheng, Christoph Somsen, Yujiao Li, Aleksander Kostka, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Alfred Ludwig, Christina Scheu
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To investigate the correlation between $\text{Ru}$ content, microstructural defect formation, and electrocatalytic activity in $\text{Au}-\text{Pd}-\text{Pt}-\text{Ru}$ compositionally complex solid solution (CCSS) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing $\text{Ru}$ content caused lattice contraction and a microstructural transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults. This transition correlated with improved hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Electron microscopy (equipped with EDX) was essential for high-throughput structural characterization, while Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed local compositional fluctuations at grain boundaries.

- **Authors**: Bowen Zou, Yixu Wang, Xiao Shen, Philipp Krooss, Thomas Niendorf, Richard Dronskowski, Wenwen Song
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To reveal the elemental redistribution during the co-precipitation of nanosized kappa ($\kappa$) and B2 phases in an FCC matrix of an Al-alloyed lightweight steel.
- **Finding**: Correlative Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Transmission Electron Microscopy (TKD-TEM) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed two co-nanoprecipitation modes. APT showed that B2 precipitates adjacent to $\kappa$ (B2I) were FeAl-type, while isolated B2 (B2II) were NiAl-type. The near-atomic resolution provided by APT was crucial in demonstrating that Fe-Ni atomic exchange between $\kappa$ and B2 drives the B2 phase evolution towards FeAl-type, improving the stability of both phases during co-precipitation.

- **Authors**: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To discover and characterize ferroelastic twin boundaries and their potential ferroelectric behavior in vapor-deposited $\text{CsPbI}_{3}$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Low-dose Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) directly revealed the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries parallel to $\{110\}$ and $\{112\}$ in the centrosymmetric $\text{CsPbI}_{3}$. Crucially, STEM observations showed that $\text{Pb}$ atoms shift at $\{110\}$ twin boundaries, driving a local ferroelectric-like polarization, thereby uncovering previously hidden ferroic functionality in this semiconductor.

- **Objective**: To grow high-quality $\alpha$-$\text{In}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$ single crystals with minimized carrier density by employing a Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique.
- **Finding**: Structural and compositional analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed the formation of pure $\alpha$-$\text{In}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$ single crystals with 3R stacking. This growth method resulted in a remarkably low carrier density ($1.5-3.2 \times 10^{16} \text{ cm}^{-3}$), indicating a significant suppression of $\text{Se}$-vacancies compared to conventional methods, as verified by the compositional analysis.

- **Authors**: Oleksandr S. Pylypchuk, Victor V. Vainberg, Denis O. Stetsenko, Oleksii V. Bereznikov, Taisiia O. Kuzmenko, Serhii E. Ivanchenko, Bohdan Pokhylko, Vladyslav Kushnir, Lesya Demchenko, Volodimir N. Poroshin, Victor I. Styopkin, Anna N. Morozovska
- **Date**: 2026-01-17
- **Objective**: To study the electric charge transport and dielectric properties of spark-plasma sintered $\text{BaTiO}_{3}$ ceramics as a function of carbon content.
- **Finding**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to estimate and visualize the concentration and distribution of carbon impurity within the samples. The study found that conduction is determined by the Mott variable range hopping mechanism, and the colossal relative dielectric permittivity ($\approx 10^5 - 10^6$) is inversely related to the carbon concentration, validating the Heywang model for describing the conduction mechanisms.

**36. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in ultrathin $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ thickness approaches the percolation threshold.

APT quantified oxygen segregation at GBs (enrichment factor $C_{\text{gb}}/C_{\text{grain}}$), finding that higher oxygen concentration in the $\text{Nb}$ grains leads to greater segregation. This atomic-scale quantification established a correlation between oxygen impurities and the suppression of the superconducting critical temperature ($T_{\text{c}}$), contributing to qubit decoherence mechanisms.
