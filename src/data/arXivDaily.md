**1. [An Instrument for Physical Vapor Deposition onto Cryo-EM Samples for Microsecond Time-Resolved Cryo-EM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20522v1)
- **Authors**: Wyatt A. Curtis, Constantin R. Krüger, Axel P. Tracol Gavard, Jakub Hruby, Marcel Drabbels, Ulrich J. Lorenz
- **Date**: 2025-12-23
- **Objective**: To describe the design and operation of a new apparatus for physical vapor deposition (PVD) onto frozen cryo-EM samples, enabling microsecond time-resolved experiments.
- **Finding**: The apparatus successfully deposits compounds, such as ultrathin $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ membranes, onto frozen cryo-EM samples, allowing for altered environments upon flash melting to initiate dynamics or remove preferred particle orientation. As a demonstration, the minimum thickness of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ sealing membranes required for laser flash melting experiments was determined to be just over two monolayers, establishing a crucial component for integrated microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM platforms.

**2. [Microscopic and spectroscopic evidences for multiple ion-exchange reactions controlling biomineralization of $\mathrm{CaO} \cdot \mathrm{MgO} \cdot 2\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ nanoceramics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20067v1)**
- **Authors**: R. Vahedifard, E. Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on nanostructured $\mathrm{CaO} \cdot \mathrm{MgO} \cdot 2\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ (diopside) coatings when soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF).

**15. [Influence of $\mathrm{Pt}/\mathrm{Ru}$ ratios on the oxidation mechanism of $\mathrm{MCrAlYTa}$ coatings modified with $\mathrm{Pt}-\mathrm{Ru}$ overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v1)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad

- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between temperature and thickness on ferroelastic domain wall ($\text{DW}$) morphology and dynamics in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films, particularly across the monopolar-to-dipolar crossover regime.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* heating **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** combined with a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach, a distinct thermal and size dependence was mapped. $\text{DWs}$ in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) were mobile near $T_C$ ($\approx 550^\circ\text{C}$) and froze upon cooling, while $\text{DWs}$ in the crossover regime (200-300 nm) were nearly static with curvature an order of magnitude lower at room temperature, revealing how thickness governs the evolution across super-elastic and freezing regimes.

**30. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To directly image nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{B}20$-structured $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ crystals using Fresnel Lorentz transmission electron microscopy ($\text{LTEM}$) and analyze the limitations of conventional chiral discrimination.
- **Finding**: $\text{LTEM}$ in Fresnel mode successfully imaged the ultrasmall skyrmion lattices. Analysis using the transport of intensity equation ($\text{TIE}$) revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon. Through systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations, this misinterpretation was attributed to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function ($\text{CTF}$) correlating with defocus values and skyrmion dimensions, establishing quantitative limitations for Fresnel contrast analysis in nanoscale magnetic imaging.

**31. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies in $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet, and determine if they arise from chiral spin textures (Topological Hall Effect).
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they lacked correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, distinguishing them from typical Topological Hall Effect ($\text{THE}$) signatures. Crucially, additional **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** measurements definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in this material. The anomalies are therefore attributed to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity, demonstrating that $\text{THE}$-like signals in bulk systems may originate from trivial mechanisms.

- **Finding**: $\text{CDIP}$ combines untrained coordinate-based neural fields for static and dynamic reconstructions with a physics-consistent forward model, overcoming the instability of traditional phase retrieval. Evaluation on simulated and experimental datasets demonstrated that $\text{CDIP}$ substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability, offering a broadly applicable framework for coherent imaging modalities including ptychography and holography using X-ray, electron, and optical probes.

**33. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for controlling three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings using externally applied strain, investigating mechanisms like elongation, tilting, and collapse.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and micromagnetic simulations predicted that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, and drives rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. Experimental validation on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample using *in situ* **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, identifying strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction ($\text{DMI}$) as the primary control mechanism.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To investigate and quantify the out-of-distribution ($\text{OOD}$) generalization performance of neural network segmentation models used for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ($\text{HRTEM}$) imaging with respect to varying imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: By training and testing over $12,000$ neural networks using synthetic data generated via multislice simulation, the study showed that network performance smoothly and predictably degrades as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. The **HRTEM contrast transfer function (CTF)** was used to develop a framework that compares information content of $\text{HRTEM}$ datasets and quantifies $\text{OOD}$ domain shifts, demonstrating significant performance stability within the tested domain.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To investigate the critical influence of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $\text{(Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnets.
- **Finding**: Fabrication of $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys revealed compressive strain up to $25\%$ near grain boundaries, as characterized by **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**. Calculations using the full-potential Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker method showed that while $K_{\rm u}$ is positive ($4.2 \text{ MJ/m}^3$) under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with $25\%$ compressive strain, demonstrating that lattice distortions critically govern magnetic properties, especially in $\text{Pr}$-rich alloys.

- **Authors**: Giannis Thalassinos, Alan G. Salek, Daniel Stavrevski, Qiang Sun, Mitchell O. de Vries, Colin M. MacRae, Nicholas C. Wilson, Andrew G. Tomkins, Dougal G. McCulloch, Andrew D. Greentree
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence of photoluminescent color centers in lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond), proposing it as a new quantum-grade crystalline platform.
- **Finding**: A new defect, $\text{RU}1$, was identified in meteoritic lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable emission across $550-800$ nm, peaking at $\sim 700$ nm, with a $14$ ns excited-state lifetime and no detectable blinking. **Correlative electron microscopy** confirmed the lonsdaleite host lattice structure, and compositional analysis suggested N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents, indicating the discovery of a new family of solid-state quantum emitters in hexagonal diamond.

**37. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To observe and understand the spatial evolution and mechanisms of helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress using *in situ* techniques.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)**, the manipulation and reorientation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) under stress were observed, showing that the critical stress depends on the angle with the stress direction. Magnetic defects were found to mediate the reorientation via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes, suggesting that strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction ($\text{DMI}$) plays a key role in this energy-efficient magnetic nanophase control.

**38. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the emergence and control of Surface Spirals ($\text{SS}$) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces ($\text{FCI}$) in chiral magnets, focusing on the role of the conical phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that the in-plane reorientation ($\phi_0$) of the conical phase controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of $\text{SS}$s at $1\text{D}$ and $2\text{D}$ $\text{FCI}$s. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed the formation of $\text{SS}$s at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, establishing $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for designing magnetic states with potential multi-state memory functionalities.

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox concerning the synthesizability and quenchability of the metastable, high-conductivity solid-state electrolyte $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ by constructing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation ($\text{TTT}$) diagram.
- **Finding**: Density functional theory calculations showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to its low surface energy, drastically lowering the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and **electron microscopy**, which captured the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase particles and their subsequent slow transformation, providing a rational framework for synthesizing functional metastable materials.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelate thin films with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) significantly above the previously reported $\sim 40$ K cap.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset at $\sim 63$ K was achieved in epitaxial $\text{(La,Pr)}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium growth method ($\text{GAE}$). Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity and inherent metastability of the strained phase. The films exhibited a systematic evolution from Fermi-liquid-like ($\alpha \sim 2$) to strange-metal-like ($\alpha \sim 1$) resistivity behavior as $T_c$ increased, identifying nickelates as an anisotropic-$3\text{D}$ high-$T_c$ system.

**41. [Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04045v1)**
- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning ($\text{ML}$) denoising pipeline suitable for time-series high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ($\text{HRTEM}$) images with low signal-to-noise ratio ($\text{SNR}$) and capable of excellent out-of-distribution generalization for *in situ* experiments.
- **Finding**: The pipeline, utilizing a blind-spot convolution neural network, outperformed various $\text{ML}$ and non-$\text{ML}$ methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features in $\text{HRTEM}$ images. The model demonstrated excellent out-of-distribution generalization and a computational inference speed in the order of milliseconds per image, making it drastically faster than $\text{U-Net}$-based models and suitable for real-time application in *in situ* $\text{HRTEM}$ experiments.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2$-$\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides ($\text{HEOs}$) and resolve the stability boundaries between bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive multi-length-scale characterization package, including X-ray diffraction ($\text{XRD}$) and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction**, was crucial to identify boundaries between closely related phases, such as bixbyite local order that persists up to $\sim 50\%$ $\text{Ce}$ but is invisible to $\text{XRD}$ and $\text{TEM}$. The study also demonstrated that kinetic quenching in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase even with a large oxygen vacancy concentration ($\sim 16.7\%$).

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the $\text{Co}$ $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ through interfacial engineering by coupling it with different perovskite oxide layers ($\text{LaTiO}_3$, $\text{LaMnO}_3$, $\text{LaAlO}_3$, $\text{LaNiO}_3$).
- **Finding**: X-ray absorption spectroscopy identified interfacial charge transfer resulting in partial $\text{Co}$ $d^7$ or $d^5$ orbital occupancy depending on the adjacent layer. A $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer resulted in a $\text{Co}$ $d^6$ low spin state, confirming that the spin state is governed by the interfacial environment. High-resolution **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** imaging established a clear connection between the observed interfacial strain and the resulting spin configuration, highlighting the importance of structural control in correlated oxides.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize hexagonal $\text{GeSn}$ solid solutions using high pressure and temperature to achieve a volume-expanded modification with superior optoelectronic characteristics.
- **Finding**: Subjecting $\text{Ge}$ and $\text{Sn}$ to pressures of $9-10$ GPa and temperatures up to $1500$ K resulted in the ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal $2\text{H}$, $4\text{H}$, and $6\text{H}$ $\text{GeSn}$ solid solutions ($\text{P}6_3/\text{mmc}$). **Precession electron diffraction** and chemical analysis using **electron microscopy** confirmed the hexagonal symmetry, which was accessible below $21$ atom $\% \text{Sn}$, demonstrating a new route to tune crystal symmetry and properties for optoelectronic applications.

**45. [On the relation between microstructure and impact toughness of 17-4__PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14702v1)**
- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To establish quantitative correlations between microstructural evolution and the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical behavior (impact toughness) of 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam ($\text{PBF-LB}$) following aging treatments.
- **Finding**: $\text{PBF-LB}$ specimens exhibited high tensile strength but consistently low impact toughness. Multiscale microstructural characterization using **scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM)** identified that strain-induced transformation of reversed austenite enhanced ductility. However, $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions, identified as micro-cavity nucleation sites, proved detrimental to toughness, and the distribution of $\text{Cu}$-rich nanoprecipitates (observed via TEM) dictated a pronounced strength-toughness trade-off.

**46. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast ($\text{DPC}$) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{STEM}$).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations confirmed that $\text{DPC-STEM}$ measurements are highly sensitive to instrumental alignment. For a $21$ mrad probe, defocusing by $4$ nm resulted in the electrostatic field magnitude being underestimated by up to $16\%$. Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations exceeding $40\%$ for magnitudes below $3$ nm, underscoring the critical need for optimized instrumental alignment to ensure accurate Center of Mass ($\text{CoM}$) based $\text{STEM}$ imaging.

- **Finding**: Uniform, continuous monolayer graphene was successfully grown directly on three different perovskite oxide substrates ($\text{SrTiO}_3$, $\text{LaAlO}_3$, etc.) under the same optimal growth conditions, confirming a reproducible, transfer-free fabrication route. Comprehensive characterization, including **electron microscopy**, confirmed the layer quality, and low-temperature measurements of the $\text{graphene/SrTiO}_3$ heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena such as substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To improve the homogeneity and quality of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite films on textured silicon bottom cells using a $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer to achieve higher efficiency monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells.
- **Finding**: The $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer successfully fostered organic precursor incorporation across the $\text{MeO-2PACz/perovskite}$ interface, preventing the formation of residual $\text{PbI}_2$ and leading to larger apparent perovskite grains and improved film quality. This robust growth modification resulted in a highly efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell with a certified efficiency of $29.7\%$.

- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To discover and characterize the ferroelectric microstructures and dynamic behavior of chemically ordered ferroelectric $\text{Pb}(\text{Sc}_{1/2}\text{Nb}_{1/2})\text{O}_3$ ($\text{PSN}$).
- **Finding**: Intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains were discovered in ordered $\text{PSN}$. *In situ* **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** using dark-field imaging demonstrated that electric polarization fluctuates around the $[111]$ direction despite the formation of long-range ordered rhombohedral domains, which accounts for the unique weak relaxor properties. *In situ* heating $\text{TEM}$ successfully revealed the dynamic movement of domain walls and the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence near the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition.
