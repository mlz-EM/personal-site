- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: Study the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_{x})_{2}\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Tune the $\text{Co}\ 3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_{3}$ through interfacial engineering by forming heterostructures with various perovskite oxides.
- **Finding**: Interfacial engineering successfully tuned the Co orbital occupancy from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state, and the Co spin state was shown to be governed by the interfacial environment (e.g., a $\text{LaAlO}_{3}$ spacer layer induced a $\text{Co}\ d^6$ low spin state). High-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed a clear connection between interfacial strain and the resulting spin configuration.

Precession Electron Diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy confirmed the hexagonal symmetry and correlated its formation with Sn uptake, establishing a new binary materials landscape.

**11. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Image simulations demonstrated that defocus significantly underestimates the electrostatic field magnitude (up to $30\%$ for a $30\ \text{mrad}$ probe), while two-fold astigmatism introduces orientation-dependent variations exceeding $40\%$. The analysis confirms the sensitivity of DPC-STEM and underscores the importance of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate center-of-mass (CoM) based imaging.

**17. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: Introduce and characterize a new class of coherent crystalline interfaces, termed "e-coherent," where coherency is enhanced by local, non-affine relaxations (discohesions).

- **Authors**: Roger Guzman, Ján Rusz, Ang Li, Juan Carlos Idrobo, Wu Zhou, Jaume Gazquez
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: Introduce an electron linear dichroism methodology in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) to directly visualize orbital occupation and electronic anisotropies at individual atomic columns with sub-angstrom precision.
- **Finding**: By utilizing momentum-transfer-dependent Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) in STEM, the $\text{Mn}-3d\ e_{g}$ orbital polarization was resolved with sub-angstrom precision in strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_{3}$ thin films. The results showed that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^2-r^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^2-y^2$, achieving the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity.

- **Authors**: Ana Senkić, Rachael Keneipp, Petra Ivatović, Namrata Pradeep, Vincent Meunier, Marko Kralj, Marija Drndić, Nataša Vujičić
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: Demonstrate and characterize a structural phase transition induced by tungsten (W) doping in bilayer ($\text{2L}$) $\text{MoS}_{2}$ synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
- **Finding**: Increasing W concentration induces a phase transition in $\text{2L}\ \text{MoS}_{2}$ from the non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to the centrosymmetric $\text{AB}'$ stacking, evidenced by the vanishing second harmonic generation (SHG) signal. Aberration Corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (AC-STEM) was used to demonstrate the spatial distribution of W concentration and the associated structural changes, confirming W-doping as an effective strategy for phase control.

- **Objective**: Introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for accurately determining the twist angles in artificially stacked cuprate heterostructures ($\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{CaCu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$).
- **Finding**: Twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, specifically the out-of-plane $\text{A}_{1g}$ mode at $116\ \text{cm}^{-1}$, provide clear optical fingerprints that allow for the precise, non-invasive quantification of rotational misalignment between cuprate layers. This method offers a stable alternative to conventional characterization tools like electron microscopy, which can damage the unstable twisted interface.

- **Authors**: Qiao Wang, Ping-An Hu
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: Report the discovery of high plasticity in the ternary germanium-based single-crystal van der Waals material $\text{GaGeTe}$ and clarify its deformation mechanism.
- **Finding**: $\text{GaGeTe}$ exhibits high plasticity, overcoming the inherent brittleness of traditional germanium-based chalcogenides.

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: Systematically analyze the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in anisotropic $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{N}$ thin films to study structural and electronic property changes induced by Ge substitution.
- **Finding**: Electron microscopy confirmed the structural transition from cubic $\text{Fe}_4\text{N}$ ($x=0$) to a tetragonal phase for $x>0.35$. The tetragonal samples ($x=0.8$ and $1$) displayed an unusual two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects, which was attributed to the coexistence of two crystallographic orientations (c-axis and a-axis normal to the film surface) and the opposite sign of the anomalous effects along these different magnetization directions, as supported by DFT calculations.

**28. [Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13917v1)**
- **Authors**: Anand Ithepalli, Saumya Vashishtha, Naomi Pieczulewski, Qiao Liu, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Matthew Barone, Darrell Schlom, David A. Muller, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Objective**: Investigate the influence of c-plane sapphire substrate miscut angle on the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of MBE-grown niobium nitride (NbN) thin films.
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images revealed that the critical thickness for NbN on c-sapphire is approximately $10~\mathrm{nm}$, regardless of the substrate miscut angle, above which the film adopts a columnar growth structure. While structural quality improved significantly with increasing miscut (as shown by XRD), the $T_c$ only marginally increased from $12.1~\mathrm{K}$ to $12.5~\mathrm{K}$, demonstrating that the critical thickness is a fundamental limitation independent of miscut angle.

**29. [Data-efficient U-Net for Segmentation of Carbide Microstructures in SEM Images of Steel Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11485v1)**
- **Authors**: Alinda Ezgi Gerçek, Till Korten, Paul Chekhonin, Maleeha Hassan, Peter Steinbach
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: Develop a data-efficient deep learning pipeline using a lightweight U-Net to accurately segment carbide microstructures in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of steel alloys despite limited annotated data.
- **Finding**: The U-Net model, trained on only 10 annotated SEM images, achieved a high Dice-Sørensen coefficient of $0.98$ for carbide segmentation, significantly outperforming classical image analysis methods ($0.85$). This demonstrates the potential of data-efficient deep learning to rapidly and accurately quantify complex microstructures captured by SEM, crucial for accelerated alloy design and reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

**30. [Mechanistic Transition from Screw to Edge Dislocation Glide Enhances High-Temperature Strength in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10869v1)**
- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: Integrate mechanical testing, scattering, microscopy, and simulation to uncover the mechanism driving the transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation in refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs).
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) provided microstructural evidence confirming that increasing the V content in the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system induces substantial atomic misfit, which preferentially raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual mechanistic transition to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, resulting in markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures.
