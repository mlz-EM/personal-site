**1. [Ultrastrong and ductile CoNiMoAl medium-entropy alloys enabled by L12 nanoprecipitate-induced multiple deformation mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15596v1)**
- **Authors**: Min Young Sung, Tae Jin Jang, Sang Yoon Song, Gunjick Lee, KenHee Ryou, Sang-Ho Oh, Byeong-Joo Lee, Pyuck-Pa Choi, Jörg Neugebauer, Blazej Grabowski, Fritz Körmann, Yuji Ikeda, Alireza Zargaran, Seok Su Sohn
- **Date**: 2025-08-21
- **Objective**: Introduce novel Co-Ni-Mo-Al alloys with L1$_2$ precipitates to understand the strengthening mechanisms and achieve improved mechanical properties.
- **Finding**: The (CoNi)$_{81}$Mo$_{12}$Al$_7$ alloy achieved a yield strength of 1086 MPa, tensile strength of 1520 MPa, and ductility of 35%, demonstrating an impressive synergy of strength and ductility. Dislocation analysis via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations, revealed that Mo substitution for Al in the L1$_2$ phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting multiple deformation modes including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation, which are facilitated by low stacking fault energy and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries.

- **Finding**: Single-variant altermagnetic RuO$_2$(101) thin films with fully epitaxial growth on Al$_2$O$_3$(1-102) r-plane substrates were confirmed through rigorous structural analyses. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), alongside X-ray diffraction and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism, played a crucial role in confirming the single-variant formation, which is attributed to the mutual correspondence of oxygen atom occupancy on the surfaces of RuO$_2$(101)[010] and Al$_2$O$_3$(1-102)[11-20]. Spin-splitting magnetoresistance was further observed in the single-variant RuO$_2$(101)/CoFeB bilayers.

Further analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) revealed that ZrO$_x$ corresponds to tetragonal ZrO$_2$. Room temperature characterization showed that ZrO$_2$ exhibits a low tunnel barrier height, which is promising for merged-element transmon applications.

**12. [Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942v1)**
- **Authors**: Vaibhav Choudhary, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Objective**: Improve feature localization in secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and helium ion microscopy (HIM), by developing a more detailed physical abstraction for the incident beam's spatial profile.

- **Objective**: Study the difficult intercalation of sodium (Na) into highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) under various conditions, focusing on thermodynamics, kinetics, and evidence for two-sided intercalation.
- **Finding**: It was found that Na insertion equilibrium in HOPG requires high temperatures, with chemical intercalation changing from thermodynamic to diffusion and finally interfacial control as temperature decreases. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed the unexpected fact that at high temperatures, Na predominantly enters HOPG in the form of two-sided intercalation sandwiching carbon layers (bilayers), while at low temperatures, more highly aggregated layers and higher-dimensional crystal imperfections appear, explaining the peculiar features and non-monotonic thermodynamics in the Li-Na-K-Rb-Cs sequence.

- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: Determine the intrinsic magnetic properties, specifically anisotropy, at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ permanent magnets using first-principles calculations, informed by sophisticated experimental characterization.
- **Finding**: First-principles calculations, based on recently reported high-resolution electron microscopy images, determined magnetic moments and crystal field coefficients for two model interface structures: a stoichiometric twin and a "stacking fault." The interfaces were found to modify magnetic properties at the sub-nm scale; particularly, in the R-rich region of the "stacking fault," the local easy axis of magnetization rotates by $49^\circ$ from its bulk direction, which may lead to reduced coercivity through easier nucleation of reverse domains.

- **Finding**: Combining atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), density first-principles calculations, and discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, high-density, sessile Frank dislocation loops with zero-net Burgers vectors were identified as the key mechanism. STEM revealed these loops form via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed perfect dislocations under stress, a process unique to iridium among face-centered cubic metals. These immobile loops act as potent barriers, drastically increasing yield strength and work hardening by impeding dislocation glide and consuming mobile dislocations.

- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: Elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, specifically investigating structural and electronic properties of La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.
- **Finding**: Using **multislice electron ptychography** and **electron energy-loss spectroscopy**, the study found that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, ensuring near-stoichiometry and bulk superconductivity under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$, which introduces quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers, ultimately suppressing superconductivity, revealing a competition distinct from cuprates.

- **Authors**: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: Directly measure the premixed phase at the interfaces of sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which are known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions.
- **Finding**: Through **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**, the study provided direct experimental evidence of a disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers. This finding contradicts previous a priori predictions of an amorphous interlayer and suggests that the existence of a crystalline premix is attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.

- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28

- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: Investigate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions in FeRh thin films, specifically focusing on how cumulative laser irradiation alters the nucleation pathway.
- **Finding**: Using the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ **transmission electron microscopy**, the study observed that repeated laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, switching it from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This led to a $20 K$ decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned by underlying dislocation networks, which were formed and rearranged upon repeated phase transitions, establishing a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: Examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) in an optical trap.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that functionalized SiNPs (with ZnCl$_2$ and single-stranded deoxyadenosine/deoxythymidine monophosphate) in an optical trap exhibit distinct differences in oscillation frequency, width, and amplitude of peaks compared to non-functionalized SiNPs, which could be explained by a theoretical model and detected by linear discriminant analysis and random forest modeling. **Transmission electron microscopy** was performed but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types, indicating the optomechanical method's sensitivity to subtle surface functionalization not apparent morphologically.
