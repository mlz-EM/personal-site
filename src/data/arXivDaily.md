-   **Objective**: Systematically investigate the influence of vanadium (V) doping density on the electronic and optical properties of tungsten disulfide (WS$_{2}$) monolayers, focusing on the complex interactions between introduced dopants and intrinsic sulfur vacancies.
-   **Finding**: At low concentrations, V-dopants enhanced native optical properties of WS$_{2}$, but at higher concentrations, they promoted the formation of vanadium-sulfur vacancy complexes that generated tunable mid-gap states. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), combined with photoluminescence microscopy and first-principles calculations, identified attractive interactions between p-type V-dopants and n-type monosulfur vacancies, providing a mechanistic understanding of how dopant-defect interactions govern property changes in transition metal dichalcogenides, guiding rational design for optoelectronic, catalytic, and quantum devices.

Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction, both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, were crucial in revealing this preferred chirality. In-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) further verified a "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis by reproducing the transformation of SnS$_{2}$ nanoribbons into nanotubes in real time, providing direct evidence for the chirality-selective growth mechanism.

-   **Authors**: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas Müller, Andreas Bezold, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
-   **Date**: 2025-06-18
-   **Objective**: Introduce a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method to enable full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and L1$_{2}$ crystals, overcoming the traditional edge-on imaging limitation.
-   **Finding**: The new HRSTEM method eliminates the long-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis, providing comprehensive access to inclined stacking faults on all glide planes. Its robustness was demonstrated in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even in overlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. Simulations revealed that fault-induced de-channeling, strongly governed by the fault's depth, is key to contrast formation, and this effect can be leveraged to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae for enhanced atomic-scale studies.

-   **Authors**: M. D. Dong, X. B. Cheng, M. Zhang, J. Wu
-   **Date**: 2025-06-18
-   **Objective**: Discover and investigate the coexistence and strong coupling of ferroelectric and superconducting orders at the interface of LaAlO$_{3}$/KTaO$_{3}$(111) (LAO/KTO).
-   **Finding**: Ferroelectric order was confirmed at the LAO/KTO interface, where it coexists with superconductivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed K ions are displaced relative to Ta ions, aided by oxygen vacancies at the interface, leading to local electric polarization. Manipulating this ferroelectricity changed interfacial conductivity by more than 1000 times, simultaneously causing superconductivity to diminish and reappear, demonstrating a strong coupling between these phenomena. STEM provided direct structural evidence of the ferroelectric distortion at the interface.

-   **Date**: 2025-06-16
-   **Objective**: Conduct a comprehensive study of the Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Co$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (GMCO) system to understand the influence of Mn substitution on its crystal and magnetic structure at low temperatures.
-   **Finding**: Phase separation was surprisingly observed in GMCO with a targeted nominal composition of Ge$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Co$_{2}$O$_{4}$, consisting of a Mn-rich primary phase and a Ge-rich secondary phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with EDX analysis was crucial in revealing these compositional inhomogeneities and their approximate stoichiometries. The study found that while both phases crystallize in cubic symmetry at room temperature, they exhibit distinct low-temperature magnetic ordering (ferrimagnetic vs. antiferromagnetic), and the estimated magnetic entropy is significantly suppressed.
