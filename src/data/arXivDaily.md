-   **Authors**: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas MÃ¼ller, Andreas Bezold, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
-   **Date**: 2025-06-18
-   **Objective**: Introduce a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method to enable full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals, overcoming the traditional edge-on limitation.
-   **Finding**: The new HRSTEM method allows for the discrimination of inclined stacking faults, providing comprehensive access to faults on all glide planes along [001] and [110] zone axes. The robustness of the method was demonstrated in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even in overlapping configurations and thick foils. Simulations revealed that fault-induced de-channeling, strongly governed by the fault's depth, is key to contrast formation, and this effect can be leveraged to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae for enhanced atomic-scale studies.

**47. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
-   **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
-   **Date**: 2025-06-11
