- **Objective**: To develop a methodology for reconstructing the size-dependent complex dielectric permittivity of individual $CsPbBr_{3}$ perovskite nanocrystals from ensemble absorbance spectra.
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully extracted the intrinsic permittivity by incorporating a size distribution derived from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) into a Maxwell Garnett effective medium model. This TEM-informed approach allowed for the determination of spectral linewidths consistent with single-nanocrystal emission at room temperature.

- **Authors**: Giovanni Ceccio, Kazumasa Takahashi, Yuto Kondo, Romana Miksova, Vasily Lavrentiev, Josef Novak, Eva Stepanovska, Jiri Vacik
- **Date**: 2026-01-22

- **Finding**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that Ar irradiation caused significant surface restructuring, creating corrugated and porous surfaces, whereas C irradiation left the films relatively homogeneous. These morphological changes observed via SEM were directly correlated with the observed shifts in the films' electrical resistance.
