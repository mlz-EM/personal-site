**1. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+δ}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.
- **Finding**: Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown $La_2PrNi_2O_7$, which is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers, which ultimately suppresses superconductivity. Multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy were employed to investigate the structural and electronic properties, revealing the Pr site preference and the formation of the striped interstitial oxygen order.

**2. [Experimental evidence of disordered crystalline premixing in sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01484v1)**
- **Authors**: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: To perform a direct measurement of the nm-scale premixing of reactants at interfaces in sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers.
- **Finding**: A disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase was directly measured at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which contradicts previous predictions of an amorphous interlayer. This disordered FCC phase retains its symmetry after annealing, with lattice parameter shifts consistent with an Al-rich composition. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was the key technique used to directly observe and characterize this crystalline premixed phase.

- **Finding**: Synchrotron measurements in grazing incidence geometry can simultaneously measure conical diffraction and diffuse scattering, with the diffraction component sensitive to the average groove profile and diffuse scattering dependent on the roughness morphology of blazed gratings. These findings are supported by numerical simulations. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to provide complementary data for the analysis, validating the synchrotron approach for modern optical elements nanometrology.

Heitmann, Matthias Frontzek, William D. Ratcliff, Gregory T. McCandless, Julia Y. Chan, Elton J. G. Santos, Jeehoon Kim, Charudatta M. Phatak, Vadym Kulichenko, Luis Balicas
- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and magnetic properties of $Fe_3GaTe_2$ single crystals, focusing on local inversion symmetry breaking and its magnetic ground state.
- **Finding**: $Fe_3GaTe_2$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking despite global centrosymmetry, which provides a convincing explanation for the presence of N\'{e}el skyrmions. The material's ground state is globally ferrimagnetic, undergoing a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase transition that affects the skyrmion density. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were crucial for revealing the local inversion symmetry breaking, and Lorentz-TEM enabled the direct observation of N\'{e}el skyrmions, while magnetic force microscopy (MFM) observed magnetic bubbles at the phase boundary.

**8. [Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To revisit contrast transfer mechanisms in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to understand where information is encoded and identify new imaging modes.
- **Finding**: The study generalizes phase contrast theory to 4D-STEM, showing that tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) under the weak phase object approximation. Beyond this, contrast can be enhanced at selected frequencies, and a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) can be constructed from incoherent scattering for depth sectioning. This framework provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, highlighting how 4D-STEM data can be maximally exploited.

- **Authors**: Dmitry Lapkin, Cong Yan, Emre Gürsoy, Hadas Sternlicht, Alexander Plunkett, Büsra Bor, Young Yong Kim, Dameli Assalauova, Fabian Westermeier, Michael Sprung, Tobias Krekeler, Surya Snata Rout, Martin Ritter, Satishkumar Kulkarni, Thomas F. Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during processing.
- **Finding**: Pressing SCNCs distorts their fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Heat treatment, applied for organic crosslinking, significantly affects planar defects, causing stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes. In-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses were crucial for observing these defect dynamics and rearrangements at the supercrystalline scale (tens of nm).

**10. [Femtosecond Engineering of magnetic Domain Walls via Nonequilibrium Spin Textures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20701v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To directly image the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation.
- **Finding**: A rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps was observed, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs formed and spontaneously vanished within picoseconds, explained by a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving hybrid transition states. Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation was employed to directly image these real-time DW formation dynamics, providing insights into femtosecond control of spin textures.

**11. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware metric for assessing the practical performance of phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) is a more accurate, dose-aware metric than the contrast transfer function (CTF) for evaluating STEM phase retrieval methods. Center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, while iterative ptychography shows a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography's SSNR at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds. This work highlights the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivates SSNR for more accurate performance assessment in STEM phase retrieval.

- **Authors**: Elizaveta Gangrskaia, Thomas Schachinger, Christoph Eisenmenger-Sittner, Lorenz Grünewald, Sebastian Mai, Andrius Baltuška, Audrius Pugžlys, Alessandra Bellissimo
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation, specifically for probing magnetic dipole transitions in $Eu^{3+}$ ions.
- **Finding**: The combination of spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses with $Eu^{3+}$:$Y_2O_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna provides enhanced magnetic dipole transition excitation. Excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam yielded a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition compared to other beams, offering new opportunities for spectroscopy of forbidden transitions. While not explicitly an electron microscopy paper, the "nanoscale sample engineering" involved in integrating nanostructures often relies on EM for characterization and quality control.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the atomic-scale organization of dipoles within polar layers of ultrathin $ZrO_2$ films.
- **Finding**: Ultrathin $ZrO_2$ films exhibit strikingly non-uniform dipole organization within irreducibly narrow polar layers, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls that alternate between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations. These walls adopt distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-$nm^2$ footprint, representing the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls nested within self-organized polar-nonpolar layering. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in plan-view orientation was essential for observing these atomic-scale features and dipole arrangements.

- **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) successfully resolves heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantifies hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This technique offers exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy and three-dimensional quantification, demonstrating its transformative capability for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, which is challenging for conventional transmission electron microscopy.

- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements for direct ptychography by leveraging insights from parallax imaging.
- **Finding**: Parallax imaging can be formulated as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, and this insight enables upsampling in direct ptychography, thereby relaxing its traditional resolution limitation imposed by probe step size. The study demonstrates analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions, showing how this approach can improve the efficiency of electron ptychography techniques by reducing sampling requirements.

- **Authors**: An-Hsi Chen, Parul R. Raghuvanshi, Jacob Cook, Michael Chilcote, Jason Lapano, Alessandro R. Mazza, Qiangsheng Lu, Sangsoo Kim, Yueh-Chun Wu, T. Zac Ward, Benjamin Lawrie, Guang Bian, James Burns, Jonathan D. Poplawsky, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Lucas Lindsay, Hu Miao, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Valentino R. Cooper, Matthew Brahlek
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: High-quality, phase-pure altermagnetic (hexagonal NiAs-structure) and non-centrosymmetric (cubic ZnS-structure) MnTe polymorphs can be selectively grown on In-terminated (111)A and P-terminated (111)B InP surfaces, respectively. Electron microscopy (EM) was used to characterize the structural quality and phase purity of the grown films, and together with photoemission spectroscopy and reflection high-energy electron diffraction, it indicated that phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface.

**17. [Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364v1)**
- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To experimentally demonstrate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions in FeRh thin films.
- **Finding**: Cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in $FeRh$ thin films, switching it from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned by underlying dislocation networks, which form and rearrange upon repeated laser exposure. In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was critical for observing these changes with high structural and magnetic resolution, establishing a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped $Cd_3As_2$ thin films using accelerator-based fast ion implantation.
- **Finding**: Fast ion implantation successfully enhanced the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) in Nb-doped $Cd_3As_2$ thin films by over 100% (e.g., maximum NLMR over $B = 9$ T for bulk-doped films vs. $B = 4$ T for pristine) compared to pristine films, while maintaining crystallinity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the crystallinity of the thin films after ion implantation, confirming that the enhancement was achieved without significant structural degradation, demonstrating the potential of this route for chiralitronic functionalities.

**19. [Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940v2)**
- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals using levitated optomechanics with functionalized silica nanoparticles.
- **Finding**: Functionalized silica nanoparticles ($SiNPs$) with $ZnCl_2$ and single-stranded deoxyadenosine/deoxythymidine monophosphate showed distinct differences in their oscillation frequency, width, and amplitude when optically trapped in vacuum, enabling detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to characterize the particles, although it did not reveal any visual differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized particle types, highlighting the sensitivity of the optomechanical detection method.

**20. [Computation and Sensitivity Analysis of the Deformation-Gradient Tensor Reconstruction in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17929v1)**
- **Authors**: Brinthan Kanesalingam, Darshan Chalise, Carsten Detlefs, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To develop an inverse modeling framework for Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to explicitly relate angular shifts to strain and lattice rotation tensors, and to perform sensitivity analysis.
- **Finding**: An inverse modeling formalism was developed for DFXM, demonstrating that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible using oblique diffraction geometry. A computational framework was also established to forward calculate anticipated angular shifts and reconstruct the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for individual pixels, along with methods for sensitivity analysis to relate tensor components to DFXM angles and compute associated errors. While DFXM is an X-ray technique, the paper discusses its advantages over transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for bulk materials by offering high spatial resolution and a large field-of-view (hundreds of $\mu$m).

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To improve the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes in multislice electron ptychography (MEP) by augmenting existing iterative solvers with a generative prior.
- **Finding**: MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on crystal structures, was developed as a generative prior and integrated into existing MEP reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). This hybrid approach significantly enhanced the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods, addressing the ill-posed nature and computational cost of traditional iterative solvers in electron ptychography.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality and investigate its origin and coupling to external fields in tetragonal tungsten bronzes, specifically $K_4Bi_2Nb_{10}O_{30}$ and $Rb_4Bi_2Nb_{10}O_{30}$.
- **Finding**: Ferrochirality was demonstrated in $K_4Bi_2Nb_{10}O_{30}$ and $Rb_4Bi_2Nb_{10}O_{30}$, which undergo an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from $P4/mbm$ to $P4_212(00\gamma)q_{00}$. The chirality originates from cooperative helical displacement of $Bi^{3+}$ atoms, representing the primary order parameter, with a secondary spatially varying piezoelectric response. High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy was used to solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures, revealing the atomic-scale origin of chirality and suggesting electric-strain-field coupling for switching.

- **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the fragmentation and coalescence mechanisms of copper ($Cu$) nanoparticles subjected to femtosecond (fs) laser scanning, particularly focusing on undesired ablation during sintering applications.
- **Finding**: Femtosecond laser-induced ablation in copper nanoparticles is predominantly driven by nonthermal electron dynamics (hot electron blast, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and blast pressures above 4 GPa) rather than classical melting or evaporation (Coulomb explosion). Particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a bimodal transformation into sub-60 nm debris and large aggregates, confirming the ablation and partial fusion processes.

- **Authors**: Shamail Ahmed, Federico Rossi, Hanyu Huo, Johannes Haust, Franziska Hueppe, Juergen Belz, Andreas Beyer, Juergen Janek, Kerstin Volz
- **Date**: 2025-07-22
- **Objective**: To investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling for solid-state batteries.
- **Finding**: During the first lithiation, silicon electrodes transform into a heterogeneous mix of crystalline $Li_{15}Si_4$, various amorphous $Li_xSi$ phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure becomes predominantly amorphous with thread-like features and minimal remaining crystallinity, evolving into a more uniform amorphous microstructure by the 10th delithiation. Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial for investigating these microstructural evolutions while preventing ambient exposure and ensuring structural integrity.

- **Authors**: B. Huang, Y. Q. Yang, M. H. Li, Y. X. Chen, X. Luo, M. S. Fu, Y. Chen, Xierong Zeng
- **Date**: 2025-07-21
- **Objective**: To investigate the local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fiber, which is important for reinforced metal matrix composites, using both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED).
- **Finding**: The SiC grains in the first deposition stage show almost random preferred orientation and scattered grain size. In the second and third stages, two kinds of texture, (110) and (111), and (110) and (115), respectively, are observed, with grain sizes around 200 nm, being lower in the third stage due to lower temperature. Precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the local texture, and its results were in agreement with X-ray diffraction (XRD), providing detailed insights into the grain orientation and size distribution.

- **Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Objective**: To develop a highly sensitive, label-free 3D imaging technique for subcellular organization and morphology using plasmonic metamaterials to detect intracellular refractive index changes.
- **Finding**: The researchers demonstrated ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography and correlated it with electron array tomography of the same resin-embedded sample. This approach enabled axially super-resolved label-free imaging of whole cells in the range of 30-200 nm, showcasing its potential for multimodal 3D colorimetric histology at the (sub-)organelle level. Electron array tomography was crucial for validating and correlating the PE imaging results at high resolution.

- **Authors**: Jiesen Guo, Fan Yang, Yuzhou He, Xinyang Liu, Zheng Deng, Qinghua Zhang, Xiancheng Wang, Xianlei Sheng, Wei Li, Changqing Jin, Kan Zhao
- **Date**: 2025-07-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of the hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal, focusing on the interplay between short-range bond order and magnetic order.
- **Finding**: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, indicating potential ZnP bond instability. This structural insight, particularly from STEM, helped explain the observed metallic conductivity with an anomaly at the Néel temperature ($T_N = 4.5$ K), suggesting a coupling between charge carriers and triangular lattice magnetism in the presence of short-range bond order.
