**35. [Decoupling Composition and Band Gap in $κ$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterostructures via STEM-EELS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08728v1)**
- **Authors**: Annett Thøgersen, Georg Muntingh, Lasse Vines, Øystein Prytz, Max Kneiß, Marius Grundmann, Holger von Wenckstern, Ingvild J. T. Jensen
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To resolve band gap variations across $\kappa$-$\text{Ga}_2\text{O}_3$-based multilayers with nanometer-scale precision and decouple the effects of composition and strain at heterointerfaces.
- **Finding**: Monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) was employed with a custom analysis framework to reliably extract band gap excitations from layers only a few nanometers thick. STEM-EELS demonstrated that for heterostructures grown on ITO, interfacial strain induced a gradual band gap transition from $5.08~\mathrm{eV}$ to $4.28~\mathrm{eV}$ over $\sim 10~\mathrm{nm}$, despite an abrupt compositional change, establishing STEM-EELS as a powerful tool for nanoscale electronic characterization.

**36. [Mechanical and electrical properties of a nano-gap or how to play the nano-accordion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08727v1)**
- **Authors**: Simon Hettler, Raul Arenal
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To analyze the relationship between the (thermo)electric properties and specific crystal orientations of a misfit layered compound using an in-situ TEM device featuring a nano-sized gap.
- **Finding**: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies utilized a device where a nano-gap facilitated precisely controllable mechanical bending via differential heating currents. The electrical in-situ TEM measurements revealed that the nano-gap strongly influenced the electrical properties, leading to a high intrinsic voltage that was dependent on the vacuum environment, largely attributed to the presence of adsorbed molecules within the gap region.

- **Authors**: Grace Guinan, Michelle A. Smeaton, Brian C. Wyatt, Steven Goldy, Hilary Egan, Andrew Glaws, Garritt J. Tucker, Babak Anasori, Steven R. Spurgeon
- **Date**: 2025-11-11

- **Authors**: Arthur R. C. McCray, Stephanie M. Ribet, Georgios Varnavides, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To introduce a deep generative prior (DGP) framework for electron ptychography to enhance noise robustness, accelerate convergence, and minimize manual regularization tuning in atomic-resolution imaging.
- **Finding**: The DGP framework parameterizes the complex-valued sample and probe within a multislice forward model used for electron ptychography reconstruction. Compared to pixel-based methods, the DGP approach offers four key advantages for electron microscopy: greater noise robustness and improved information limits at low dose, markedly faster convergence, improved depth regularization, and minimal user-specified regularization, establishing it as a robust approach for high-resolution imaging.

**39. [The Microscopic Structure of Stacking Faults in Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06983v2)**
- **Authors**: Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland
- **Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the microscopic structure and local effects of regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material $\text{Sr}_2\text{NaNb}_5\text{O}_{15}$.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used, complemented by symmetry mode analysis and force-field calculations, to characterize the defects. TEM analysis showed that the stacking faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four, resulting in four possible domains related to $\text{NbO}_6$ octahedral tilts. The investigation revealed that these stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, suggesting they could influence the ferroelectric properties.

Atomic-scale imaging provided direct mechanistic insight by showing both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, along with gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns, illustrating how interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics drive diamond formation in aqueous systems.

- **Authors**: Akira Yasuhara, Takumi Sannomiya, Ryoichi Horisaki
- **Date**: 2025-11-08

- **Authors**: Joshua Renner, Matthew A. Wright, Kristofer Bouchard, Bruce E. Cohen, Peter Ercius, Azriel Goldschmidt, Cassio C. S. Pedroso, Ambarneil Saha, Peter Denes
- **Date**: 2025-11-06
- **Objective**: To develop Back-Propagation Counting (BPC), a robust machine learning method for accurate single-electron counting in direct electron detectors, especially under high electron flux.
- **Finding**: BPC is shown to be robust to increasing occupancy in synthetic data, successfully counting multiple electron strikes per pixel. In experimental electron microscopy (EM) data, frames counted with BPC produced diffraction peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher intensity and generated images with improved contrast compared to standard methods, demonstrating its efficacy for high-flux EM experiments such as *in situ* TEM movies and diffraction.

- **Authors**: Henry C. Hammer, Caleb Whittier, Nathan A. Helvy, Christopher Rouleau, Nabil D. Bassim, Ravitej Uppu
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To demonstrate controlled, low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of $\text{Er}^{3+}$-doped $\text{TiO}_2$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates for monolithic integration of quantum memories and photon sources.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that low-temperature growth ($390~^\circ\mathrm{C}$) on specially prepared substrates resulted in epitaxial anatase $\text{TiO}_2$ (001) films with sub-$300~\mathrm{pm}$ surface roughness and atomically sharp interfaces. In contrast, high-temperature growth led to rough, polycrystalline rutile films, as verified by TEM. This multi-parameter strategy, confirmed by EM, yields a materials platform suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures.

- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of irregular crystallization in ZBLAN glass under combined thermal and vibrational effects using FEM simulation and a redesigned experimental setup.
- **Finding**: Comprehensive microscopic, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses were used to characterize the resulting crystalline phases. These EM techniques revealed that higher vibration frequencies accelerate nucleation (incipient crystalline phases forming around $330~^\circ\mathrm{C}$) and enhance the transformation into well-developed crystalline structures, emphasizing the need for precise thermal and vibrational control in glass processing.

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the limitations and potential sources of error when using annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) to identify point defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride ($\text{hBN}$).
- **Finding**: Using STEM image simulations and experiments, the study demonstrated that due to the $\text{AA}'$ stacking of $\text{hBN}$, the contrast differences required to distinguish between boron/nitrogen columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable in ADF-STEM images at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic layers (ca. $6~\mathrm{nm}$). Furthermore, the work showed that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can significantly distort the STEM contrast, leading to misleading interpretations and misidentification of atomic defects.

- **Authors**: Ilia Zykov, Guido Stam, Hanieh Jafarian, Amin Moradi, Peter Neu, Rudolf Tromp, Mariana Amaro, Thomas Juffmann, Sense van der Molen
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To introduce Optical Near-field Electron Microscopy (ONEM), a novel, non-invasive, label-free technique that converts optical near-field intensity patterns into photoelectron emission for super-resolution imaging.
- **Finding**: ONEM achieves $31~\mathrm{nm}$ spatial and sub-second temporal resolution using low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) principles, but without exposing the sample to electrons, thereby preserving structural integrity. The technique was demonstrated by imaging polarization-dependent plasmon modes and capturing real-time electrodeposition of copper nanoclusters from solution, establishing ONEM as a versatile platform for damage-free super-resolution imaging of interface dynamics in both vacuum and liquid.
