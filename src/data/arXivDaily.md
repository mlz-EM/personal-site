- **Authors**: Reed Yalisove, Hongrui Zhang, Xiang Chen, Fanhao Meng, Jie Yao, Robert Birgeneau, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To investigate skyrmion metastability and zero-field magnetic states in the van der Waals ferromagnet $(Fe_{0.5}Co_{0.5})_{5}GeTe_{2}$ (FCGT).

- **Authors**: Gillian Nolan, Edmund Han, Shahriar Muhammad Nahid, Patrick Carmichael, Arend M. van der Zande, André Schleife, Pinshane Y. Huang
- **Date**: 2026-01-27
- **Objective**: To study the atomic and electronic structure of strongly charged domain walls in the ferroelectric material $\alpha$-$In_{2}Se_{3}$.

The researchers mapped the complex, curved 3D structures of $180^{\circ}$ domain walls and identified localized conducting states at the walls through band structure calculations. These findings suggest that these domain walls are excellent candidates for 2D electron/hole gases and domain wall engineering.

- **Authors**: Alyssa Ang De Guzman, Anish Mathai Varghese, Saif Alshalloudi, Lance Kosca, Kyriaki Polychronopoulou, Marko Gacesa
- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants to evaluate their suitability for in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and oxygen production.
- **Finding**: The researchers used Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and XRD to validate the mineralogical fidelity of the simulants to Apollo and Chang'e samples. The study found that while ilmenite is the most reducible phase, the overall oxygen extraction behavior is governed by the whole-regolith response, including Fe-bearing silicates and glassy phases. This supports the use of whole-regolith processing strategies for future lunar settlements.

Combined with operando monitored reduction, the researchers achieved wide-range modulation of electron occupancy from $3d^{7}$ to $3d^{9}$. The results indicate that the SIT in nickelates involves a mixture of 2D and 3D superconducting characters, deviating from the canonical 2D model.
