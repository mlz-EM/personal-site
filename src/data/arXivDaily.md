- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7}$ and La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ to understand the effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that Pr dopants in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7}$ preferentially occupy outer La sites, ensuring near-stoichiometry and bulk superconductivity under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing of La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, which, as observed using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, introduces quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers, ultimately suppressing superconductivity and highlighting a competition between this oxygen order and superconductivity.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial in identifying the crystallinity of this premixed phase, which retained its symmetry after annealing, with lattice parameter shifts consistent with an Al-rich composition, attributing its existence to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.

Coupled with the observation of Néel skyrmions via Lorentz-TEM, this structural analysis provides a compelling explanation for their presence in centrosymmetric materials. Furthermore, thermodynamic evidence suggests a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, with neutron diffraction studies indicating a change in magnetic configuration between Fe1 and Fe2 moments upon field reduction, correlating with the hysteresis observed in skyrmion density and magnetization.

- **Finding**: The study re-examined contrast transfer mechanisms in 4D-STEM using H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism, revealing how information is encoded and identifying new imaging modes. It demonstrated that tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) imaging, derived from summing symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk, enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximally uses 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation. Furthermore, the work showed usable information in the dark field region by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF), promising for depth sectioning of strong scatterers, and providing analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography.

- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps, particularly focusing on the effects of heat treatment.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that processing steps significantly influence the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in SCNCs. X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses showed that pressing distorts the fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults. Crucially, heat treatment, also used for organic crosslinking, caused stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes, providing new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered nanoparticle assemblies with remarkable mechanical properties.

- **Finding**: The study successfully imaged the real-time formation of domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation using Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation. Researchers observed a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient asymmetric DW state, and short-lived DWs forming and vanishing within picoseconds in a narrow fluence window. Multiscale simulations revealed a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs, explaining the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, moving beyond the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study introduces spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a superior, dose-aware metric for evaluating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, overcoming the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF) which neglects finite electron fluence and Poisson-limited detection. Using numerical reconstructions, the researchers showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, while iterative ptychography surprisingly shows dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography's SSNR at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds, highlighting SSNR's accuracy for assessing STEM phase retrieval.

While the abstract does not explicitly mention electron microscopy, the "nanoscale sample engineering" and "nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna" imply that electron microscopy techniques would be essential for characterizing the morphology and integration of these nanoscale elements, which is critical for the observed enhancement of magnetic dipole transitions.

- **Finding**: The study revealed a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures in ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, demonstrating the atomic-scale confinement of strongly charged 180-degree domain wall pairs within irreducibly narrow polar layers. Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in plan-view orientation, the researchers observed that dipoles within these polar planes are strikingly non-uniform, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, making them some of the smallest domains reported in any polar material and opening new pathways for atomically dense memories.

- **Finding**: The study experimentally demonstrated that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, causing a switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high structural and magnetic resolution was crucial for observing these changes, revealing that dislocation networks, formed and rearranged upon repeated phase transition crossings with femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses, pin these vortices, establishing a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

- **Finding**: The study examined the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) in levitated optomechanical experiments, where SiNPs trapped by a 1550 nm laser in vacuum behaved as harmonic oscillators. While the core detection relies on optomechanical measurements and statistical analysis (linear discriminant analysis, random forest modeling) to distinguish functionalized from non-functionalized SiNPs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types, indicating that the observed differences were subtle and related to their dynamic behavior rather than gross morphology.

High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures, revealing that chirality originates from cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms, and proposing electric-strain-field coupling as a conjugate field for switching chirality.
