- **Finding**: The study correlated sub-bandgap optical transitions with dislocation densities in epitaxial ZnS grown on GaP. **Scanning electron microscopy-based electron channeling contrast imaging (SEM-ECCI)** was used to quantify the densities of four predicted partial dislocations. Room-temperature ellipsometry revealed absorption peaks scaling with dislocation density, and low-temperature photoluminescence showed deep emission peaks matching 1D band-to-band transitions. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy identified six distinct emission lines, with four assigned to dislocations exhibiting modest suppression ($\leq$5$\times$) when excited below the ZnS bandgap, supporting the existence of efficient 1D radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core states.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To investigate the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface.
- **Finding**: The study reported the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism when enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers were adsorbed on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. **Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM)** measurements revealed spin-dependent electron reflectivity, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments ruled out artifacts or chirality-induced spin selectivity. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations attributed the magnetism to strong chemisorption, causing hybridization between molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, leading to asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface.

A novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1$^\circ$ was discovered in monolayer 1T-VS$_{2}$, which evolved into a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure with increasing layer number. Angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy showed that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as V$^{3+}$ ions in multilayer VS$_{2}$ and are responsible for this CDW superstructure evolution.

- **Authors**: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To conduct an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation in a ductile aluminum alloy to understand the transition from microstructure-sensitive short cracks to load-controlled long cracks.

The study found that microstructure-sensitive cracks grow quasi-brittlely at low energy release rates until a critical rate, where plastic deformation blunts the crack, marking a transition to plasticity-dominated crack arrest. This establishes the short-to-long crack transition as process-zone governed.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate a novel mechanism for tuning strain in Mott insulator thin films by controlling substrate morphology, thereby influencing phase transitions.
- **Finding**: The study showed that minute changes in sapphire substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped, created by annealing) can reverse the dominant strain state in V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ films, allowing thermally-induced tensile strain to overcome lattice-mismatch-induced compressive strain. This control over strain resulted in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases, leading to orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. **High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM)** was used to image atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in the V$_{2}$O$_{3}$, elucidating the strain relaxation mechanism.

- **Finding**: The study demonstrates, through simulated 2-D experiments using variational inference with score-based diffusion models, that reliable image reconstructions can be achieved in position-blind ptychography. This is possible with the right illumination structure and a strong prior, even under measurement noise, indicating the potential for applications like single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging where beam positions relative to particles are unknown.

Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling observed in Ru-capped RuO$_{2}$/Fe bilayers, challenging the assumption that it arises from altermagnetic ordering in RuO$_{2}$.
- **Finding**: The study reveals that the observed EB behavior in RuO$_{2}$/Fe bilayers is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$, which undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature, rather than altermagnetic ordering in RuO$_{2}$. *Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM)*, along with polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron reflectometry, and SQUID measurements, was crucial in characterizing the interlayer and confirming the non-altermagnetic origin of EB.

**38. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that can overcome the limitations imposed by speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA systems.
- **Finding**: The research proves that sequential SA imaging of diffuse scenes is fundamentally impossible with per-measurement-independent speckle, and then develops a snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome this. Remarkably, simulations demonstrate that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information, thereby improving the resolution of SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures.

**40. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$ at ambient conditions.

These defects, observed using *scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)* and corroborated by enhanced atomic displacement parameters in single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) data, are argued to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state, highlighting the importance of structural disorder for UTe$_{2}$'s superconducting properties.

- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Objective**: To elucidate the influence of water and carbon dioxide concentrations in the plating solution on the quality and deposition yield of terbium and thulium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: The study found that water concentrations exceeding 1 vol.-% and the presence of CO$_{2}$ negatively impact the quality of terbium thin films produced by Molecular Plating, leading to increased carbonate content. *Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)* was used to analyze the morphology of the thin films, complementing chemical analysis by infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which revealed the formation of hydroxides, oxides, and carbonates.

- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To observe and understand the size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes, linking it to classical nucleation theory.
- **Finding**: Using *in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy* down to 20 K, the study observed a melting point depression of CDWs in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. This size-dependent behavior, consistent with classical nucleation theory and a Ginzburg-Landau model, showed that as flake size approaches the CDW correlation length (10-50 nm), long-range order is limited, lowering the transition temperature and even leading to the absence of CDWs in very small flakes.

- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To develop correction methods for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging to accurately estimate the true surface pore size and porosity in nanoporous membranes, accounting for imaging artifacts.
