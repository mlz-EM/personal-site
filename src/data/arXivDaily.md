**1. [Deep Learning-Assisted Weak Beam Identification in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05017v1)**
- **Authors**: A. Benhadjira, C. Detlefs, S. Borgi, V. Favre-Nicolin, C. Yildirim
- **Date**: 2025-09-05
- **Objective**: To develop a deep learning framework for automating the identification of weak-beam versus strong-beam conditions in Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) for dislocation characterization.

**9. [Molecular Beam Epitaxy of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21537v1)**
- **Authors**: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the epitaxial growth and interfacial properties of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
- **Finding**: High substrate growth temperature (825$^\circ$C) yielded optimal structural properties for the 2D-overlayer, which grew unstrained after monolayer deposition. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provided evidence of pits at the interface, likely due to GaN thermal decomposition. In-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed electron transfer from n-GaN(0001) to 2H-TaS$_2$ and the formation of nitrogen vacancies near the interface, while also ruling out chemical reactions, suggesting the potential for integrating 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with 3D GaN.

**12. [Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20930v1)**
- **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To control polarization direction and chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films by manipulating the interplay between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain.
- **Finding**: The study found that anisotropic compressive strain in BFO films on LSMO-buffered NdGaO$_3$ substrates promotes ferroelectric domain formation despite electrostatic stabilization of uniform out-of-plane polarization. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on oppositely polarized regions stabilizes the nanoscale domain architecture. This mechanism was leveraged to stabilize uniform out-of-plane polarization, and local polarization switching experiments revealed signatures of homochiral polarization textures, opening new pathways for functional domain-wall and domain-based electronics.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for microstructural characterization, revealing that these introduced dislocations significantly mitigated cleavage crack formation during nanoindentation compared to as-received material. The mechanically seeded dislocations in subsurface layers facilitated stable plastic deformation, thereby preventing brittle fracture.

- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced experimental techniques with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that previously observed broad transitional regions in STEM images, interpreted as a transient nonpolar intermediate phase, are actually projection artifacts arising from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of $180^\circ$ domain walls. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films confirmed this, while simulations revealed that switching proceeds via collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, consistent with nucleation-limited switching and explaining the zigzag domain walls.

- **Finding**: The study observed a phase transition where highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe while preserving crystal orientation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to investigate the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface, revealing that clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures drives the transition, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through minor GeSe$_2$ segregation. A high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$ was observed, highlighting GeSe's potential for electronic applications.

- **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: To investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations within the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand its underlying mechanisms and impact on mechanical properties.
- **Finding**: The study identified a novel cross-slip mechanism where Shockley partial dislocations ($a/6<112>$) cross-slip from one $\{111\}$ plane to another conjugate $\{111\}$ plane, facilitated by stair-rod dislocation formation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were crucial for characterizing defects (stacking faults, dislocations) and associated chemical fluctuations, revealing that elemental segregation reduces activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies, thereby enhancing high-temperature deformation resistance.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was critical for dislocation analysis, revealing that Mo substitution in the L1$_2$ phase altered dislocation behavior, promoting multiple deformation modes including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These findings, supported by DFT calculations, demonstrate a novel strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs.

By leveraging reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, they interpreted core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy analogous to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) quantification. This method, while challenged by differences in elemental interaction ranges, can be overcome by comparison with simulations that generalize Cliff-Lorimer k-factors, offering a robust approach for dopant characterization in electron microscopy.
