- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To investigate field-induced phase transitions and negative differential resistance (NDR) in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) in In$_2$Se$_3$ FeS-FETs, attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. High-resolution electron microscopy, combined with electrical transport measurements, revealed that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moire patterns), and intralayer shear, collectively producing stress-induced phase transitions.

**7. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v1)**
- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and fracture mechanism in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture in the DP steel at 900 MPa within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies showed intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology at crack initiation. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and, later, $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking after significant crack growth. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies on cross-sectional cracks, combined with TEM observations, supported a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism where hydrogen promotes decohesion at grain boundaries and brittle fracture at high crack velocities, inhibiting crack blunting.

**8. [Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166v1)**
- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: To investigate how dopants self-organize and modulate local structural short-range order within amorphous interfacial complexions in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and elemental analysis revealed chemical partitioning at both grain and interphase boundaries, with the amorphous-crystalline transition region enriched in certain dopants. While nanobeam electron diffraction provided qualitative structural short-range order, atomistic simulations with a custom machine learning interatomic potential quantitatively showed that increased grain boundary chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure. Segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions was found to drive local structural changes sensitive to dopant ratios, demonstrating the intimate connection between local chemistry and order.

This automation, which was previously a subjective and slow manual task, enables robust, rapid, and scalable identification of imaging conditions. This advancement transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool, facilitating statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials, which are crucial for understanding the mechanical behavior of crystalline materials.

A bilayer recipe enabled the creation of freestanding membranes, maximizing index contrast and yielding high-quality nanopatterns by circumventing etching-induced defects. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the suspended membrane, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation extracted its mechanical properties. The resulting all-polymer metasurfaces experimentally delivered high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, enabling straightforward geometry-based tuning.

- **Finding**: Room-temperature Brinell indentation generated a plastic zone in bi-crystal SrTiO$_3$ without crack formation, allowing direct assessment of GB-dislocation interaction. Combined with dislocation etch pits imaging and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, the study observed dislocation pileup, storage, and transmission across the low-angle tilt GB. These experimental observations provide new insights into dislocation-GB interaction at room temperature at the mesoscale, which is crucial for developing strategies for crack suppression and dislocation engineering in polycrystalline ceramics.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provided evidence of pits at the interface, likely due to GaN thermal decomposition. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) showed core level shifts consistent with electron transfer and nitrogen vacancy formation, but no chemical reaction at the interface. STEM was vital for visualizing the interface structure and defects, corroborating the potential for integrating 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with 3D semiconducting GaN.

**20. [Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20930v1)**
- **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To investigate and control polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films by balancing epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry.
- **Finding**: The study showed that large anisotropic compressive strain in BFO films on LSMO-buffered NdGaO$_3$ substrates promotes ferroelectric domain formation, despite the expected stabilization of uniform out-of-plane polarization by the LSMO termination. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that the nanoscale domain architecture is stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization. STEM was critical for atomic-scale visualization of this surface layer and domain configurations, enabling new strategies for controlling polarization direction and chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics.

- **Finding**: Integrating advanced thin-film fabrication, switching dynamics, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, the study demonstrated that broad transitional regions previously observed in STEM images are projection artifacts of intrinsic 3D zigzag 180$^\circ$ domain walls. STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films confirmed this. Simulations revealed switching proceeds via collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, explaining zigzag domain walls and nucleation-limited switching.

- **Finding**: The study observed a phase transition from highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe to semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe, preserving crystal orientation, induced by global annealing or localized laser heating. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to investigate the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface, revealing that clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures drives the transition, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through minor GeSe$_2$ segregation. TEM provided critical insights into the atomic-scale structural changes during this transition, which results in a high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$.

- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: Investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations in the ordered gamma prime phase of a CoNi-based superalloy and understand its underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study observed Shockley partial dislocations cross-slipping from one $\{111\}$ plane to another $\{111\}$ conjugate plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize defects, stacking faults, dislocations, and associated chemical fluctuations, revealing that elemental segregation reduces the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies. Local stress concentrations also play a critical role, and this mechanism enhances the alloy's high-temperature deformation resistance.
