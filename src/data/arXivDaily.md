-   **Finding**: The study revisited H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism to understand information encoding in 4D-STEM data, identifying new imaging modes that can also serve as crude but fast approximations to ptychography. It showed that tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) enable aberration-corrected bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximally uses 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond WPOA, usable information encoded in the dark field region was demonstrated by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up incoherent scattering components, holding promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps, particularly focusing on the role of heat treatment.
-   **Finding**: Through X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses, the study revealed how processing steps influence supercrystalline defects: pressing distorts the otherwise fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults. Crucially, heat treatment, similar to that applied for organic crosslinking, caused planar defects like stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes, providing new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles with remarkable mechanical properties.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-28
-   **Objective**: To directly image and understand the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation.
-   **Finding**: Using Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy, the researchers directly imaged the rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered domain wall (DW) arrays within 10 ps in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. Multiscale simulations combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics revealed a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs, explaining the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering, and establishing a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials on femtosecond timescales.

-   **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
-   **Date**: 2025-07-25
-   **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware metric for assessing phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), addressing the limitations of the conventional contrast transfer function (CTF).
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) is a more accurate, dose-aware metric for evaluating STEM phase retrieval methods compared to the contrast transfer function (CTF), which often overestimates practical performance in low-dose regimes. Using numerical reconstructions, it showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, while iterative ptychography's SSNR surprisingly depends on dose, converging to direct ptychography at low fluence and saturating at high fluence, consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds.

-   **Objective**: To develop and test an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology to enhance and achieve high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation, specifically for probing magnetic dipole transitions in $Eu^{3+}$ ions.
-   **Finding**: The researchers developed a novel setup combining spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses with $Eu^{3+}$:$Y_{2}O_{3}$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. This approach demonstrated a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition in $Eu^{3+}$ when excited with an azimuthally polarized beam compared to a radially polarized or conventional Gaussian beam, providing new opportunities for spectroscopy of inherently weak magnetic dipole transitions by enhancing optical magnetic field excitation.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-25
-   **Objective**: To investigate the atomic-scale organization of dipoles within ultrathin $ZrO_{2}$ films, specifically to observe and characterize 180-degree domain walls and their confinement.
-   **Finding**: Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in plan-view orientation, the study revealed that within the irreducibly narrow polar layers of ultrathin $ZrO_{2}$ films, dipole organization is strikingly non-uniform, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls. These walls, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, adopt completely distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-$nm^2$ footprint, representing the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls nested within self-organized polar-nonpolar layering, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale.

-   **Objective**: To overcome the challenges of precisely determining atomic-scale hydrogen distribution in solids due to its weak electron scattering and high mobility, by demonstrating the capabilities of multislice electron ptychography (MEP).
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes limitations of conventional TEM by providing exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP successfully resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides, establishing MEP as a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids and unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-24
-   **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements of direct ptychography by formulating parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to it, thereby enabling scan-upsampling.
-   **Finding**: The study formulated parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, using this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography and relax its traditional Nyquist sampling requirements. This allows for the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave with optimal transfer using non-iterative techniques, even with larger probe step sizes, as demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental reconstructions.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-24
-   **Objective**: To establish a method for programmable phase selection between altermagnetic (hexagonal NiAs-structure) and non-centrosymmetric (cubic ZnS-structure) polymorphs of MnTe with high structural quality on InP substrates using molecular beam epitaxy.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates enable programmable phase selectivity of MnTe polymorphs via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE): the altermagnetic NiAs-structure stabilizes on the (111)A (In-terminated) surface, while the non-centrosymmetric ZnS-structure stabilizes on the (111)B (P-terminated) surface. Electron microscopy (including reflection high-energy electron diffraction) and photoemission spectroscopy collectively indicated that phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface, with first principles calculations suggesting interfacial termination and strain significantly affect interfacial energy.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-24
-   **Objective**: To experimentally demonstrate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions, specifically investigating the effect of cumulative laser irradiation on nucleation pathways in FeRh thin films.
-   **Finding**: Using high structural and magnetic resolution in-situ transmission electron microscopy, the study observed that cumulative femtosecond and picosecond laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, switching it from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This led to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned by underlying dislocation networks, which were formed and rearranged upon repeated phase transition crossing, establishing a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-23
-   **Objective**: To enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped $Cd_{3}As_{2}$ thin films using accelerator-based fast ion implantation.
-   **Finding**: The study successfully enhanced the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) in Nb-doped $Cd_{3}As_{2}$ thin films, a signature of chiral anomaly, by employing accelerator-based fast ion implantation. Electrical transport and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize NLMR and crystallinity, revealing that surface-doped films showed maximum NLMR around $B = 7$ T and bulk-doped films over $B = 9$ T, both while maintaining crystallinity. This represents over a 100% relative enhancement compared to pristine films ($B = 4$ T), demonstrating high-energy ion implantation as a practical route for chiralitronic functionalities in topological semimetals.

-   **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
-   **Date**: 2025-07-23
-   **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals using levitated optomechanics with functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs).
-   **Finding**: The study investigated the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals using optically trapped, functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) in vacuum, observing differences in oscillation frequency, width, and amplitude of peaks in their motion spectra between functionalized and non-functionalized particles. While linear discriminant analysis and random forest modeling confirmed these differences, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out but did not reveal any visual distinctions between the particle types, indicating the optomechanical method's sensitivity to subtle surface modifications not apparent through direct imaging.

-   **Objective**: To develop an inverse modeling framework, computational framework, and sensitivity analysis for reconstructing the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) from Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) data, relating angular shifts to strain and lattice rotation tensors.
-   **Finding**: The study developed a comprehensive inverse modeling formalism for Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM), enabling the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) using oblique diffraction geometry. While this work focuses on X-ray methods, it provides a complementary approach to high spatial resolution strain measurements offered by techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, with the advantage of probing deep inside bulk materials. The developed computational framework allows for both forward calculation of anticipated angular shifts and reconstruction of the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for individual pixels, along with sensitivity analysis to relate tensor components to DFXM angles and compute associated errors.

-   **Finding**: The study introduced MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures, as a generative prior to augment existing iterative solvers for multislice electron ptychography (MEP). This hybrid approach, easily integrated via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), greatly enhanced the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes of atomic crystal structures, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods, demonstrating a powerful computational advancement for high-resolution electron microscopy imaging.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-23
-   **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality in two tetragonal tungsten bronzes, $K_{4}Bi_{2}Nb_{10}O_{30}$ and $Rb_{4}Bi_{2}Nb_{10}O_{30}$, and investigate the origin of their chirality and its coupling to external fields.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated ferrochirality in $K_{4}Bi_{2}Nb_{10}O_{30}$ and $Rb_{4}Bi_{2}Nb_{10}O_{30}$ using high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy, which helped solve their incommensurately modulated and chiral structures. Temperature-dependent XRD revealed an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from $P4/mbm$ to $P4_{2}12(00\gamma)q00$, with chirality originating from a cooperative helical displacement of $Bi^{3+}$ atoms. A spatially varying piezoelectric response was observed as a secondary effect, and invariant analysis proposed an external electric-strain-field coupling as a conjugate field for switching chirality, establishing these materials as a versatile playground for the emergent field of ferrochirality.

**45. [Mechanistic Insights into Nonthermal Ablation of Copper Nanoparticles under Femtosecond Laser Irradiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17100v1)**
-   **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
-   **Date**: 2025-07-23
-   **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanisms of undesired ablation during femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation of copper (Cu) nanoparticles, particularly focusing on fragmentation and coalescence behavior relevant to sintering applications.
-   **Finding**: The study investigated the fragmentation and coalescence behavior of Cu nanoparticles subjected to femtosecond laser scanning, revealing a bimodal transformation into sub-60 nm debris and large aggregates, with particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Analysis ruled out Coulomb explosion and identified hot electron blast as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa. This confirms that fs laser-induced ablation in Cu nanoparticles is driven predominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics rather than classical melting or evaporation, highlighting that reducing hot electron temperature can suppress ablation and expand the sintering window.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling, aiming to understand the changes from crystalline to amorphous phases.
-   **Finding**: Using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) during electrochemical cycling, the study revealed the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon anodes. After the first lithiation, the electrode showed a heterogeneous mix of crystalline $Li_{15}Si_{4}$, various amorphous $Li_{x}Si$ phases, and residual crystalline silicon; after delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features and minimal remaining crystallinity. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure was more uniform, with thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries, demonstrating that starting from a crystalline phase, a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fiber using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
-   **Finding**: The study investigated the local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fiber using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy (TEM), finding good agreement between the two techniques. It revealed that at the first deposition stage, the preferred direction of SiC grains was almost random with scattered grain sizes. At the second and third stages, two kinds of texture, (110) and (111), were observed, with grain sizes around 200 nm, and a lower grain size at the third stage due to lower temperature, confirming that the [110] preferred direction along the axial direction for SiC fiber is beneficial to its axial tensile strength.

-   **Objective**: To fundamentally understand the stability and internal structure of multi-twinned decahedral nanoparticles by characterizing their size-dependent lattice pseudosymmetry and strain using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM).
-   **Finding**: The study applied four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) strain mapping over 23 decahedral nanoparticles (edge lengths, $d$, between 20 and 55 nm), revealing the prevalence of heterogeneity in different modes of lattice distortions that homogenizes and restores symmetry with increasing size. Nanometer-resolution maps of the full 2D strain tensor revealed distinctive spatial patterns of local lattice phase transformation between face-centered cubic and body-centered tetragonal symmetries, with a clear contrast between particles below and above $d = 35$ nm, suggesting a cross-over size for the internal structure and shape transition.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in the metallic triangular lattice compound $GdZn_{3}P_{3}$.
-   **Finding**: The study investigated the hexagonal $ScAl_{3}C_{3}$-type antiferromagnet $GdZn_{3}P_{3}$ single crystal, revealing significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments further demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements confirmed long-range A-type antiferromagnetic order below $T_{N} = 4.5$ K with strong magnetic anisotropy, and despite DFT predicting it as an indirect semiconductor, the single crystal exhibited metallic conductivity with an anomaly at $T_{N}$, establishing $GdZn_{3}P_{3}$ as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carriers and triangular lattice magnetism on a background of short-range bond order.
