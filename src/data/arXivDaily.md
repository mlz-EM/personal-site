- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05

**26. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To introduce and validate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for evaluating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, overcoming the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that the contrast transfer function (CTF) significantly overestimates the practical performance of STEM phase retrieval, especially in low-dose regimes, by neglecting finite electron fluence and Poisson-limited detection. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, the researchers showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography shows a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography's SSNR at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds. This work highlights the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and establishes SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.

In the presence of the metallic antenna, excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam provided at least a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition compared to a radially polarized beam or a conventional Gaussian beam. This setup provides new opportunities for the spectroscopy of forbidden transitions, leveraging nanoscale sample engineering for enhanced optical magnetic field excitation.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To experimentally observe and characterize atomically thin, dimensionally confined, strongly charged 180-degree domain walls in ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures.
- **Finding**: Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film in plan-view orientation, the study revealed strikingly non-uniform dipole organization within irreducibly narrow polar layers. This led to the formation of atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls, at most a few unit cells long, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations. Head-to-head and tail-to-tail walls each adopt completely distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-$nm^2$ footprint, making them some of the smallest domains reported in any polar material. This work represents the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls, nested within self-organized polar-nonpolar layering, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale.

- **Objective**: To overcome the challenges of precisely determining atomic-scale hydrogen distribution in materials by demonstrating multislice electron ptychography (MEP) as a transformative method.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes the limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy for hydrogen imaging, which struggles with hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility. MEP offers exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP successfully resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides.

**30. [Relaxing Direct Ptychography Sampling Requirements via Parallax Imaging Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18610v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements of direct ptychography by formulating parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, thereby enabling upsampling in direct ptychography.
- **Finding**: Direct ptychography, while enabling optimal information transfer under the weak phase object approximation, is traditionally limited by stringent Nyquist sampling requirements dictated by the probe step size. The study formulates parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography and uses this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. The analytical results were numerically demonstrated using simulated and experimental reconstructions, showing a pathway to relax sampling requirements and achieve scan-upsampling in direct ptychography, which is beneficial for dose-efficient phase retrieval in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

Zac Ward, Benjamin Lawrie, Guang Bian, James Burns, Jonathan D. Poplawsky, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Lucas Lindsay, Hu Miao, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Valentino R. Cooper, Matthew Brahlek
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates can program the phase selectivity of altermagnetic (hexagonal NiAs-structure) and non-centrosymmetric (cubic ZnS-structure) polymorphs of MnTe during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that the phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric MnTe polymorphs can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth. The bulk altermagnetic NiAs-structure MnTe was stabilized on the (111)A surface (In-terminated), while the non-centrosymmetric, cubic ZnS-structure was stabilized on the (111)B surface (P-terminated). Electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction indicated that the phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface. First-principles calculations suggested that interfacial termination and strain significantly affect the interfacial energy, dictating polymorph stabilization.

**32. [Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364v1)**
- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To experimentally demonstrate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions, specifically observing dislocation-driven nucleation type switching in FeRh thin films.
- **Finding**: Using high structural and magnetic resolution in situ transmission electron microscopy, the researchers observed that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films. This caused the transition to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation, leading to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices as preferential nucleation motifs. These vortices were found to be pinned by underlying dislocation networks, which were observed to form and rearrange upon repeated crossing of the phase transition using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. This work establishes a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films using accelerator-based fast ion implantation.
- **Finding**: The study successfully used accelerator-based fast ion implantation to enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films. Electrical transport and transmission electron microscopy were employed to characterize the NLMR and the crystallinity of the films. Surface-doped Nb-Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films displayed a maximum NLMR around $B = 7$ T, and bulk-doped films over $B = 9$ T, representing over a 100% relative enhancement compared to pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ ($B = 4$ T), all while maintaining crystallinity. This work demonstrates the potential of high-energy ion implantation as a practical route to realize chiralitronic functionalities in topological semimetals.

- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs).
- **Finding**: Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) functionalized with ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate were optically trapped in vacuum, behaving as harmonic oscillators whose oscillation frequency and amplitude were precisely detected by optical interferometry. Data revealed differences in frequency, width, and amplitude of peaks with respect to SiNP motion, which were explained by a theoretical model. Linear discriminant analysis and random forest modeling confirmed statistical differences between functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types, suggesting the observed changes were subtle and related to surface functionalization impacting mechanical response rather than gross morphology.

- **Authors**: Brinthan Kanesalingam, Darshan Chalise, Carsten Detlefs, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To develop an inverse modeling framework for Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to explicitly relate angular shifts to the strain and lattice rotation tensors, enabling reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor, and to establish methods for sensitivity analysis and error computation.
- **Finding**: The paper developed an inverse modeling formalism for Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM), demonstrating that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible using oblique diffraction geometry. A computational framework was established to both forward calculate anticipated angular shifts and reconstruct the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for individual pixels from DFXM experiments. Furthermore, methods for sensitivity analysis were presented to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific DFXM angles and to explicitly compute associated errors. This work provides a crucial framework for interpreting past DFXM experiments and designing future ones, offering a method for spatially resolved strain measurements in bulk materials that complements high-resolution techniques like transmission electron microscopy.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To improve the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes in multislice electron ptychography (MEP) by augmenting existing iterative solvers with a generative prior based on a diffusion model.
- **Finding**: The study developed MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for multislice electron ptychography (MEP), to augment existing iterative solvers. This hybrid approach, easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes. It achieved a 90.50% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) over existing methods, demonstrating a powerful computational advancement for high-resolution imaging of atomic crystal structures from electron diffraction patterns.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality in tetragonal tungsten bronzes (K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$) and to understand the origin of their chirality and its coupling to electric-strain fields.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated ferrochirality in K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$, revealing an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from P4/mbm to P4$_2$12(00$\gamma$)q00. High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures. The chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms perpendicular to the c direction, representing the primary order parameter. A spatially varying piezoelectric response was observed as a secondary effect, consistent with the polycrystalline nature. Through invariant analysis, an external electric-strain-field coupling with piezoelectricity was proposed as a conjugate field for switching chirality, establishing tetragonal tungsten bronzes as a versatile playground for ferrochirality.

**38. [Mechanistic Insights into Nonthermal Ablation of Copper Nanoparticles under Femtosecond Laser Irradiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17100v1)**
- **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanisms of undesired nonthermal ablation in copper (Cu) nanoparticles during femtosecond (fs) laser scanning, particularly focusing on fragmentation and coalescence behaviors.
- **Finding**: The study investigated the fragmentation and coalescence behavior of Cu nanoparticles subjected to fs laser scanning, revealing a bimodal transformation into sub-60 nm debris and large aggregates (up to 750 nm) through particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). By estimating electron emission, electrostatic pressure, and hot electron temperature, the researchers concluded that Coulomb explosion is unlikely under the laser fluence used. Instead, hot electron blast, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa, was identified as the dominant nonthermal ablation pathway. This work highlights that reducing hot electron temperature can effectively suppress ablation, offering a promising strategy for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing.

- **Date**: 2025-07-22
- **Objective**: To investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study used cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes during electrochemical cycling in a solid-electrolyte-free environment, ensuring structural integrity by preventing ambient exposure. After the first lithiation, the electrode showed a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li$_{15}$Si$_4$, various amorphous Li$_x$Si phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features and minimal remaining crystallinity. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure was more uniform, with thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries. The results reveal that a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles, emphasizing the importance of initial material choice and optimized electrode architecture for stable cycling.

- **Date**: 2025-07-21
- **Objective**: To investigate the local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fiber using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: The study investigated the local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fiber using both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with results showing good agreement between the two techniques. It was found that at the first stage of deposition, the preferred direction of SiC grains was almost random with scattered grain sizes. At the second and third stages, two kinds of texture, (110) and (111), were observed. Furthermore, the grain size at the second and third stages was approximately 200 nm, with the third stage having slightly smaller grains due to lower temperature. The [110] preferred direction along the axial direction was identified as beneficial for the axial tensile strength of the SiC fiber.

- **Authors**: Oliver Lin, Zhiheng Lyu, Hsu-Chih Ni, Xiaokang Wang, Yetong Jia, Chu-Yun Hwang, Lehan Yao, Jian-Min Zuo, Qian Chen
- **Date**: 2025-07-20
- **Objective**: To understand the size-dependent lattice pseudosymmetry and internal structure of frustrated decahedral nanoparticles by mapping full 2D strain tensors using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM).
- **Finding**: Using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) strain mapping on 23 decahedral nanoparticles (edge lengths $d$ between 20 and 55 nm), the study revealed the prevalence of heterogeneity in different modes of lattice distortions, which homogenizes and restores symmetry with increasing size. Knowing the particle crystallography, distinctive spatial patterns of local lattice phase transformation between face-centered cubic and body-centered tetragonal symmetries were revealed, with a clear contrast between particles below and above $d$ of 35 nm. This suggests a cross-over size for the internal structure, correlating with a particle shape transition from modified-Wulff to faceted, pentagonal bipyramidal shape. The 4D-STEM mapping provides new insight into the long-standing mysteries of this historic system.

- **Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography for label-free 3D imaging of biological samples and correlate it with electron array tomography.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography, a novel label-free technique that utilizes plasmonic metamaterials to translate subtle changes in intracellular refractive index directly into color. This approach enables axially super-resolved label-free imaging of whole cells in the range of 30-200 nm. Crucially, the researchers correlated these optical results with electron array tomography of the same resin-embedded sample, validating the technique's ability to visualize tissue microstructure at the (sub-)organelle level. This method shows great potential for multimodal three-dimensional colorimetric histology, offering a highly sensitive, label-free alternative to traditional staining methods.

- **Date**: 2025-07-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in the metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal.
- **Finding**: The study investigated GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal, revealing long-range A-type antiferromagnetic order at $T_N = 4.5$ K with strong magnetic anisotropy. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis showed significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar layer. Crucially, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability. Despite density functional theory predicting an indirect semiconductor, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibited metallic conductivity with an anomaly at $T_N$, likely associated with the observed interstitial P atoms. This establishes GdZn$_3$P$_3$ as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carriers and triangular lattice magnetism in a two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.

- **Objective**: To characterize and quantify Zn incorporation in CuInS$_2$ quantum dots (QDs) using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and time-resolved optical spectroscopies, to understand its role in structural modifications and surface passivation.
- **Finding**: The study utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), specifically XANES and EXAFS, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_2$ QDs with element-specific precision, overcoming challenges faced by conventional techniques like electron microscopy for this purpose. This allowed for the detection of ZnS surface shell formation and the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent or an interstitial defect. Additionally, time-resolved optical spectroscopies provided deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.

- **Date**: 2025-07-13
- **Objective**: To correlate the synthesis parameters with the structural properties and thermal stability of Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ nanowires, aiming to optimize their performance for spintronic applications.
- **Finding**: The study synthesized Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ nanowires with varying bismuth content and crystalline domain sizes via template-assisted electrodeposition. Structural analysis by advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed that larger crystalline domains allowed homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, while smaller domains exhibited noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. The thermal stability was examined using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering, which showed lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice upon heating, followed by rhombohedral metallic Bi crystallization upon cooling. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing the giant spin Hall effect performance of Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ nanowires by correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features and thermal behavior.

- **Objective**: To develop and optimize a three-step molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) process for growing high-quality, optically uniform WSe$_2$ monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).
- **Finding**: A three-step molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) process was developed and optimized for growing high-quality, optically uniform WSe$_2$ monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), maximizing photoluminescence efficiency and promoting hexagonal WSe$_2$ domain formation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to estimate the dispersion of WSe$_2$ hexagonal domains orientation. The monolayer character of the film was identified using optical methods and verified with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section. Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent studies revealed exciton complex behavior analogous to exfoliated counterparts. This direct growth on hBN offers superior convenience and reproducibility compared to mechanical exfoliation, marking significant progress in the optical quality of epitaxially grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) monolayers for large-scale functional devices.

- **Date**: 2025-07-11
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the molecular-beam epitaxy of short-period Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN superlattices and optimize their growth parameters for low defect complex multilayers suitable for quantum photonic devices.
- **Finding**: The study systematically investigated the molecular-beam epitaxy of short-period Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN superlattices. X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping confirmed lattice-matching at $x = 0.14$ Sc composition, regardless of GaN interlayer thickness, evidenced by symmetric superlattice satellites aligned in-plane with the substrate. Superlattices deviating from this condition exhibited strain-induced defects. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigation of the Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor in setting nitride composition variation and band structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) further revealed delays in Sc incorporation at both onset and termination. Optimal growth conditions were observed at approximately 600°C for thick GaN layers and 550°C for ultra-thin GaN layers, leading to structurally optimized superlattices for photonic applications.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate that strain-stabilized interfacial polarization can robustly modulate the surface work function in metallic rutile RuO$_2$ layers within epitaxial RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$ heterostructures.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that interfacial polarization, a well-established concept in semiconductors, can robustly modulate the surface work function in metallic rutile RuO$_2$ layers within epitaxial RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$ heterostructures. Multislice electron ptychography was used to directly visualize polar displacements of transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite the conductive nature of RuO$_2$. This interfacial polarization enabled over 1 eV modulation of the RuO$_2$ work function, controlled by small thickness variation (2-4 nm) as measured by Kelvin probe microscopy, with a critical thickness of 4 nm corresponding to the transition from fully strained to relaxed film. These results establish interfacial polarization as a powerful route to control electronic properties in metals, with implications for designing tunable electronic, catalytic, and quantum devices.

- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To study the dynamics of graphene etching by various molecules (O$_2$, H$_2$, and CO) within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between multilayer graphene and a catalytic platinum substrate, identifying kinetic limitations.
- **Finding**: The study investigated the dynamics of graphene etching by O$_2$, H$_2$, and CO within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between multilayer graphene and a catalytic platinum substrate, using in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under the explored experimental conditions, the etching reaction rates were found to be limited by mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persisted even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting of the vdW gap. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further revealed multiple etching pathways for CO enabled by confinement within the vdW space. The work highlights that once mass-transport limitations are overcome, the vdW gap acts as an effective nanoreactor, facilitating reaction pathways that would otherwise be inaccessible on a pristine surface.

- **Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the capability of multislice electron ptychography (MEP) for 3D atomic-scale metrology of buried features in next-generation gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, specifically quantifying strain relaxation and interface roughness.
- **Finding**: The study successfully demonstrated multislice electron ptychography (MEP) as a powerful computational electron microscopy technique for 3D atomic-scale metrology of buried features in prototype gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, offering sub-Ångström lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution. From a single MEP dataset, the researchers uncovered and quantified distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. They found that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxed away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a bulk-like structure. MEP also quantified interface roughness, which was not previously possible for such small 3D structures but strongly impacts carrier mobility, revealing different atomic-scale profiles for top and bottom interfaces, reflecting their different processing conditions. This work provides direct experimental values of performance-limiting parameters needed for modeling and early fabrication optimization.
