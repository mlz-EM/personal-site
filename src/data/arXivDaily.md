- **Objective**: To develop a straightforward and accessible method for determining the crystallographic orientation of black phosphorus (BP) from bulk crystals to thin layers using angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) with a standard single-wavelength Raman setup.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed an ARPRS method, incorporating thickness-dependent interference effects and anisotropic optical indices, to reliably determine the orientation of black phosphorus across different thicknesses. This approach was validated through direct orientation measurements using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD), confirming its applicability to both thick and ultrathin samples. TEM and EBSD served as crucial validation tools, confirming the accuracy of the new, more accessible Raman-based orientation technique, thereby simplifying routine characterization of anisotropic 2D materials.

- **Authors**: Shuo Chen, Yijin Li, Xi Zheng, Guofeng Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid method for 3D surface reconstruction of complex microstructures from multi-view, multi-detector 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, addressing limitations of existing methods such as discrete 3D representations and calibration needs.
- **Finding**: NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D reconstruction method, takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural field representation. This method eliminates manual calibration procedures through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from SEM images during training, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of intricate microstructures. The effectiveness was validated on diverse samples like two-photon lithography microstructures, peach pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and broad applicability, with SEM providing the essential 2D image data for the advanced 3D reconstruction.

**35. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate both the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, specifically La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.
- **Finding**: Using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), the study revealed that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry for bulk superconductivity under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers that ultimately suppress superconductivity. Electron microscopy techniques (multislice electron ptychography and EELS) were critical for directly imaging and chemically analyzing the atomic-scale interstitial oxygen order and its impact on the electronic structure, providing key insights into the competition between this order and superconductivity.

- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To develop 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline for preprocessing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data, addressing pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions that constrain high-throughput analysis.
- **Finding**: 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline integrating attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures, was developed to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration on 4D-STEM data. Trained on large simulated datasets, the network effectively generalizes to experimental data, reducing mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieving sub-pixel center localization with average errors below 0.04 pixels. This framework significantly improves the quality of 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, facilitating high-throughput and reliable real-time analysis for automated characterization by correcting systematic biases that corrupt quantitative measurements.

- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: To perform direct measurement and characterization of the premixed phase at the interfaces of sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which are known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions.
- **Finding**: The study provides direct experimental evidence, via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), of a disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers, differing from previously reported amorphous interlayers. STEM was crucial for atomic-scale imaging and characterization, revealing the crystallinity of this premixed phase and its lattice parameter shift after annealing, consistent with an Al-rich composition. The existence of this crystalline premix is attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization, offering new insights into reactive multilayer exothermicity.

- **Objective**: To develop and implement a custom-designed automation interface for Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) that enables dual-magnification imaging by frame alternation, allowing simultaneous collection of interlaced data sets at different length scales.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed an automation interface for ESEM that minimizes human supervision and allows for the simultaneous collection of multiple interlaced data sets. By automatically changing acquisition settings after each frame, the system captures alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location. This dual-magnification ESEM imaging technique provides both a low-magnification overview of mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high-magnification field of view of ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif, enabling truly correlative cross-scale observations of catalytic systems, such as hydrogen oxidation over Co foil.

- **Date**: 2025-07-31
- **Objective**: To explore the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings, specifically by analyzing conical diffraction and diffuse scattering patterns to probe their efficiency and morphology.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that synchrotron measurements, in grazing incidence geometry, can simultaneously measure conical diffraction and diffuse scattering on blazed gratings, providing a sensitive nanometrology tool. The diffraction component of the pattern is sensitive to the average groove profile, while diffuse scattering depends on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and validated by data from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM was used to characterize the surface morphology of the blazed gratings, providing complementary data to the synchrotron measurements for a comprehensive understanding of their structure and efficiency.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and magnetic properties of the layered compound Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, focusing on local inversion symmetry breaking, the nature of its magnetic ground state, and its correlation with topological spin textures.
- **Finding**: Through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, the study revealed that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking despite maintaining global inversion symmetry, which provides a convincing explanation for the observed N\'{e}el skyrmions via Lorentz-TEM. Magnetization measurements indicated a first-order thermodynamic phase transition to a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, challenging previous claims of a glassy magnetic state. Neutron diffraction studies correlated this transition with a change in magnetic configuration, and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) showed magnetic bubbles at the phase boundary. TEM, especially Lorentz-TEM, was crucial for directly observing N\'{e}el skyrmions and providing structural evidence for local inversion symmetry breaking, linking these to the material's ferrimagnetic properties.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To develop and apply a high-throughput 2D and 3D spectro-ptychography methodology combined with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to visualize local Ni oxidation state behavior in single-crystal NMC811 cathodes with nanometer-scale spatial resolution.
- **Finding**: The study developed a high-throughput data collection strategy enabling 2D and 3D ptychography in minutes, which, when combined with XANES, allowed for nanometer-scale visualization of local Ni oxidation state variations in single-crystal LiNi$_{x}$Mn$_{y}$Co$_{z}$O$_{2}$ (NMC811). This advanced imaging technique directly mapped chemical degradation along Li channels, identified nucleation sites, and observed Ni oxidation state heterogeneities across both electrode and particle scales during lifetime cycling. These heterogeneities were correlated with rocksalt phase formation and oxygen-induced planar gliding, providing fundamental insights into the chemical degradation of high-Ni layered oxide materials.

- **Finding**: The researchers successfully fabricated ZnS nanowaveguides from RF magnetron sputtered thin films and experimentally observed second harmonic generation (SHG) in these structures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the ZnS thin films and nanowaveguides, alongside atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ellipsometry for comprehensive material characterization. The observation of SHG establishes ZnS as a promising platform for compact and integrated frequency conversion devices, with SEM providing critical insights into the physical structure of the fabricated nanowaveguides.

- **Authors**: Naresh Prajapati, Manoj Kumar, Vidit Pandey, Sandeep Munjal, Himanshu Pandey
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Objective**: To synthesize cobalt ferrite (CoFe$_2$O$_4$) nanoparticles using the sol-gel method and evaluate their photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic dyes under white LED illumination.
- **Finding**: Cobalt ferrite (CoFe$_2$O$_4$) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via the sol-gel method and annealed at $500^\circ\text{C}$. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for structural analysis, confirming the nanoparticle morphology, alongside X-ray diffraction, Raman, and Infrared spectroscopy. The material exhibited semiconducting behavior with a narrow optical bandgap and demonstrated high photocatalytic activity, decomposing 95% of methyl orange/methylene blue dye within 150 minutes under white LED irradiation, with further improvement upon H$_2$O$_2$ addition. SEM provided essential visual evidence of the synthesized nanoparticles' structure, which is crucial for understanding their photocatalytic performance.

**44. [Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data and to identify new imaging modes.
- **Finding**: The study revisits contrast transfer mechanisms in 4D-STEM, showing that tilt correction and summation of symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk (tcBF and tcDPC) enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximally utilizes 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond WPOA, it identifies contrast transfer from inelastic/plural scattering electrons (quadratic terms) and demonstrates enhanced contrast under overfocus conditions. The paper also shows usable information in the dark field region by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums incoherent scattering components, promising for depth sectioning. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory to 4D-STEM, providing analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography by leveraging the rich information contained within the 4D-STEM diffraction patterns.

Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps, using X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study reveals, through X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses, how processing steps (pressing into pellets, emulsion-templated self-assembly, and heat treatment) influence defects in SCNCs. Pressing distorts the fcc superlattice, while self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Crucially, heat treatment, also used for organic crosslinking, causes stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes, as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. In-situ STEM provided direct, real-time observation of these defect rearrangements at the supercrystalline scale (tens of nm), offering new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered nanoparticle assemblies and their remarkable mechanical properties.

- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To directly image the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation, and to understand the underlying nonequilibrium spin texture mechanisms.
- **Finding**: Using Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy (Lorentz-UEM) combined with transient optical grating excitation, the researchers directly imaged the real-time formation of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. They observed a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state, and short-lived DWs vanishing within picoseconds in a narrow fluence window. Lorentz-UEM was essential for providing direct, real-time, femtosecond-scale visualization of these magnetic domain wall dynamics, revealing a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs, establishing a framework for ultrafast spin texture control.

**47. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware statistical framework for assessing the practical performance of phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), addressing the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study introduces the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for evaluating STEM phase retrieval methods, in contrast to the CTF which neglects finite electron fluence and Poisson-limited detection. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, it was shown that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs with analytic expressions, while iterative ptychography shows a surprising dose dependence: converging to direct ptychography's SSNR at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds. This work highlights the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivates SSNR as a superior metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval performance, especially in low-dose regimes.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation, specifically to probe inherently weak magnetic dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ ions.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed an approach that combines spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses with Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. This setup provided a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition when excited with an azimuthally polarized beam compared to other beams. While electron microscopy is not explicitly mentioned as a direct finding, the success of this method critically relies on "nanoscale sample engineering," implying that techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) would be essential for fabricating and characterizing the tailored sample morphology, such as the metallic antenna and the integration of nanostructures.

- **Objective**: To experimentally observe and characterize atomically thin, dimensionally confined, strongly charged 180-degree domain walls in ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale.
- **Finding**: Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in plan-view orientation, the study provides the first experimental observation of atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls in ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films. These domain walls, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, confine in-plane domains to a sub-nm$^2$ footprint, making them among the smallest reported in any polar material. STEM was crucial for atomic-scale imaging, revealing the distinct interfacial structures of these strongly charged domain walls and demonstrating antipolar ferroic ordering nested within self-organized polar nonpolar layering, opening new pathways for atomically dense memories and domain wall nanoelectronics.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To overcome the challenges of precisely determining atomic-scale hydrogen distribution in metal hydrides, which is difficult due to hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility, and limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes the limitations of conventional TEM by offering exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP successfully resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work establishes MEP as a transformative electron microscopy method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids at the atomic scale, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.
