- **Objective**: Report a unique phase of indium selenide ($\beta^\text{p}$ phase) and demonstrate its room temperature ferroelectricity in a low-dimensional limit.
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis revealed a unique $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide with a zigzag atomic configuration and intralayer shifting in its quintuple layers, distinct from previously reported phases. This structural characteristic, confirmed by cross-sectional STEM, leads to broken inversion symmetry and ferroelectric behavior, supported by electric-field-induced switchable polarization and Second Harmonic Generation responses.

- **Authors**: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
- **Date**: 2025-10-04

**9. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: Develop and demonstrate an aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) method to improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging, especially in the presence of higher-order aberrations.
- **Finding**: The paper shows that acBF, which combines tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC), enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even with higher-order aberrations. This method leverages the phase shift from the probe-forming lens at Scherzer defocus to act as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF contrast transfer function. The superior performance of acBF over tcBF or DPC methods alone was demonstrated on both simulated and experimental 4D-STEM data.

- **Authors**: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: Directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric $SrTiO_{3}$ to define its real-space structure.
- **Finding**: Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) down to 20 K was used to directly image the low-temperature polar structure of $SrTiO_{3}$. High-resolution STEM imaging revealed a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains with finite polarization. The study observed that short-range polar domains initially grow and self-organize into a periodic structure, but this process reverses below 40 K in the quantum paraelectric regime, with periodically ordered polar nanodomains fragmenting into small clusters, providing unprecedented real-space insight.

- **Finding**: This theoretical and simulation-based work explores a novel blind inverse problem relevant to single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging, where ptychographic measurements are sensitive to unknown beam positions relative to particles. While not directly using electron microscopy, the principles of ptychography are highly relevant to 4D-STEM, and this study's findings on data-driven variational inference for position recovery could impact future advanced electron microscopy techniques requiring blind position reconstruction.

**17. [Non-Altermagnetic Origin of Exchange Bias Behaviors in Incoherent RuO$_2$/Fe Bilayer Heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22866v1)**
- **Authors**: Shelby S. Fields, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Cory D. Cress, Nicholas G. Combs, Olaf van 't Erve, Patrick G. Callahan, Keith E. Knipling, Michelle E. Jamer, Frank M. Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: Investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling in Ru-capped $RuO_{2}$/Fe bilayers to determine if it is indicative of altermagnetic ordering in $RuO_{2}$.
- **Finding**: Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to analyze the interfaces of the $RuO_{2}$/Fe bilayers. TEM, combined with other techniques, revealed that the observed EB behavior is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing $Fe_{3}O_{4}$, which undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature. This finding, supported by TEM's structural and interfacial characterization, suggests that EB alone cannot be considered evidence of altermagnetic ordering in rutile $RuO_{2}$ thin films due to interfacial chemical disorder.

- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: Investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten in air and the sublimation of tungsten oxide to assess their impact on fusion power plant lifecycles.
- **Finding**: Electron microscopy was used for characterization, revealing the formation of voids and cracks at temperatures above 600$^\text{o}$C, leading to dust formation or oxide spalling. The oxide scale was characterized as three main layers: an inner 30-50 nm thick $WO_{2}$ layer, a middle 10-20 $\mu$m $WO_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer layer of $WO_{2.9}$/$WO_{3}$ phases. Electron microscopy was crucial in observing the microstructure and morphology of these oxide layers, which is discussed in relation to oxidation kinetics and potential impacts on tritium permeation.

- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: Develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome speckle noise limitations in light-based SA systems.
- **Finding**: This theoretical and simulation-based work demonstrates that speckle noise is problematic for light-based SA systems and proves the impossibility of SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes with sequential, independent speckle measurements. The proposed snapshot SA imaging method, while not directly involving electron microscopy, offers a conceptual framework for overcoming imaging challenges that could be relevant to advanced electron microscopy techniques dealing with coherence and scattering, particularly in fields like ptychography.

- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: Investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of $UTe_{2}$ at ambient conditions.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, alongside single crystal X-ray diffraction, revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices in $UTe_{2}$ with no uranium vacancies. However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the $Te_{2}$ layers that host Te chains along the b axis. These defects, visualized and characterized by STEM, are argued to be sufficient to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in $UTe_{2}$, highlighting the critical role of structural disorder at the atomic scale.

- **Finding**: The study utilized combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy to achieve spatial and temporal resolutions an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period. This enabled direct measurement of ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles, revealing phase singularities accelerating to unbounded, superluminal velocities before annihilation, particularly amplified by slow group velocity hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes. Ultrafast electron microscopy was key to probing these topological defect dynamics at previously unattainable timescales.

- **Finding**: The authors developed four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, a method for directly tracking 3D atomic rearrangements in identical nanoparticles. Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles, they captured atomic evolution through surface reconstruction and atom leaching stages, which were corroborated by voltage-dependent behaviors probed by *in situ* electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. This technique enabled the identification of chemical short-range order at the atomic level and revealed anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations, highlighting the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into nanocatalyst design.

- **Authors**: Ernst Artes, Primiana Cavallo, Tobias Häger, Carl-Christian Meyer, Christoph Mokry, Dennis Renisch, Jörg Runke, Evgenia Schaffner, Alice Seibert, Christina Trautmann, Christoph E. Düllmann
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Objective**: To elucidate the possible influence of water and carbon dioxide concentrations present in the plating solution on the quality and deposition yields of terbium and thulium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: Terbium and thulium thin films were produced under controlled conditions, and their morphology was analyzed by *scanning electron microscopy (SEM)*. The study revealed that water in the plating solution negatively affects the quality of thin films when its concentration exceeds 1 vol.-%, while the presence of $CO_2$ leads to an increased carbonate content, which also detrimentally influences film quality. Chemical analysis using infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further confirmed the formation of hydroxides, oxides, and carbonates.

**28. [Melting point depression of charge density wave in 1T-TiSe$_2$ due to size effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16730v1)**
- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To observe and understand size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-$TiSe_2$ nanoflakes, a phenomenon rarely reported for correlated electronic states.
- **Finding**: Using *in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy* with temperature down to 20 K, the researchers observed a melting point depression of CDW for 1T-$TiSe_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, they estimated a zero-temperature correlation length of 10-50 nm, matching reported CDW domain sizes. As flake size approached the correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition was cut off, limiting long-range order and lowering the transition temperature, and for very small flakes, CDWs were absent, demonstrating that an electronic phase transition can follow classical nucleation theory.

**29. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To develop corrections for *scanning electron microscopy (SEM)* measurements to accurately estimate the true surface porosity and pore size in nanoporous membranes, accounting for imaging artifacts.
- **Finding**: The study hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during *SEM imaging* and sputter metal coatings lead to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. They showed that imaging at 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3%, and increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for UF membranes and 46% for RO supports. To account for coating thickness, they developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, yielding uncoated porosity values 3-fold greater and mean pore diameters 1.5-2 fold greater than observed with a 4 nm coating. Dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data, suggesting that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood.

- **Finding**: Using an advanced atomic-column imaging technique, *optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)*, the researchers directly observed oxygen site dynamics in freestanding membranes, revealing the polarization switching pathways. They found that 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, their work also revealed how different cation species impact the accessible polarization switching pathways, providing atomic-level insights crucial for the advanced engineering of fluorite ferroelectric materials and memory devices.

They achieved a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, showcasing the potential for adapting quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy platforms. This work opens new avenues for advanced microscopic platforms by exploiting correlations between electrons and photons.

**32. [Characterization of superconducting germanide and germanosilicide films of Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir formed by solid-phase epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14173v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Li, Zhongxia Shang, Michael P. Lilly, Maksym Myronov, Leonid P. Rokhinson
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To conduct a comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir germanides and germanosilicides, and to provide an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by solid-phase epitaxy.
- **Finding**: For films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, the researchers reported critical temperatures ($T_c$) up to 3.4 K for IrGe (2.6 K for IrSiGe). *High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM)* and *energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)* were used to reveal that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface. This detailed characterization is crucial for developing superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices based on group IV materials, potentially augmenting the functionality of quantum circuits.

- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To clarify the underlying mechanism for the substantial coercivity in $Ce(Co_{1-x}Cu_x)_5$ permanent magnets by directly observing nanoscale pinning centers.
- **Finding**: Using *transmission electron microscopy (TEM)* and atom probe tomography (APT), the researchers identified a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition in $Ce(Co_{0.8}Cu_{0.2})_{5.4}$ magnets. This structure consists of Cu-poor cylindrical cells and Cu-rich cell boundaries, which exhibit intrinsic Cu concentration gradients up to 12 at.% Cu/nm. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that these gradients lead to spatial variations in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity. This identification provides a microstructural basis for the "giant intrinsic magnetic hardness" phenomenon and highlights avenues for designing rare-earth-lean permanent magnets via controlled nanoscale segregation.

- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To understand the underlying degradation mechanisms and morphological/chemical changes in heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) during operation, which limit their operational lifetimes.
- **Finding**: The study observed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer (ETL), QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer of InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS Cd-free QD-LEDs during operation. This was accompanied by the generation and diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen radicals. *In situ transmission electron microscopy* revealed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. Acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilized the ETL/QD layers by suppressing radical formation and halting morphology changes, leading to dramatic lifetime enhancements (8-fold and 5000-fold, respectively).

- **Authors**: Vijay Kumar, Kaitlyn M. Mullin, Hyunggon Park, Matthew Gerigk, Andrew Bresk, Tresa M. Pollock, Yangying Zhu
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To accurately resolve and predict the extreme and transient three-dimensional (3D) thermal conditions during selective laser melting (SLM) in additive manufacturing, which critically influence microstructure and mechanical properties.
- **Finding**: The researchers demonstrated a unique approach coupling high-speed infrared imaging during SLM of MAR-M247 with a transient 3D multiphysics simulation to reconstruct the dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool. This integrated framework enabled the estimation of experimentally-validated 3D solidification conditions, including solidification velocities and cooling rates, and prediction of microstructure size and orientation variations. These predictions were validated with *ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM)* and electron backscatter diffraction maps, substantiating that an integrated experimental-computational approach is crucial for in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in commercial additive manufacturing.

**36. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v2)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron ptychography for imaging beam-sensitive materials, using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The authors applied the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance. They found that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but is more robust to partial coherence. This work provides a valuable framework for evaluating and comparing the performance of advanced electron microscopy techniques like *HRTEM* and *electron ptychography* in terms of dose efficiency, particularly for beam-sensitive materials.

**37. [Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO2(100) Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11568v1)**
- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To understand and control the atomic structure of the polar $CeO_2$(100) surface and its reconstruction behavior, which is essential for unraveling surface reactivity and designing advanced catalytic materials.
- **Finding**: The researchers discovered a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the $CeO_2$(100) surface through an integrated approach combining global structure search, machine learning potentials, DFT calculations, and *in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)*. This reconstructed surface, characterized by an alternating arrangement of $Ce^{3+}$ and $Ce^{4+}$ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms, was found to be both thermodynamically and kinetically stable. Importantly, the formation of localized $Ce^{3+}$ polarons introduced occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, activating these states and enhancing their electron-donating capacity, thus facilitating the dissociation of adsorbed molecules like $H_2O$.

- **Authors**: Yonghao Weng, Liqiang Gao, Linwu Zhu, Jian Huang
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To address the gap in systematically validating AI model capabilities in materials characterization and analysis by presenting MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset for this specialized field.
- **Finding**: The authors developed MatQnA, a dataset covering ten mainstream characterization methods, including *X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)*. Preliminary evaluations showed that advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao Vision Pro 32K) achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks. This demonstrates strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis, with the MatQnA dataset publicly available to facilitate further development and validation of AI models in materials science.

**39. [Intrinsic Quantum Clusters in Kagome Weyl Semimetal Co3Sn2S2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11230v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuqing Xing, Hui Chen, Li Huang, Roger Guzman, Qi Zheng, Senhao Lv, Jinan Shi, Haitao Yang, Wu Zhou, Hong-Jun Gao
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping the quantum states of the magnetic Weyl semimetal $Co_3Sn_2S_2$, a kagome lattice system, and understand their influence on spin, charge, and topological degrees of freedom.
- **Finding**: The researchers uncovered intrinsic quantum clusters, identified as native oxygen defects, on the surface of $Co_3Sn_2S_2$ via *scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy* and non-contact atomic force microscopy, combined with *scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM/EELS)*. These oxygen impurities occupy specific hollow sites on Sn-terminated surfaces, tuning the flat band near the Fermi level and exhibiting an unconventional Zeeman effect, while on S-terminated surfaces, oxygen interstitials generate occupied impurity states with reduced symmetry and no measurable magnetic response. This work establishes that intrinsic oxygen-related quantum clusters act as tunable local perturbations, offering a versatile platform to probe and engineer impurity-driven phenomena in correlated and topological systems.

**40. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam scanning trajectories (spiral and multi-pass sequential patterns) on dose-sensitive techniques, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography, in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Using $DyScO_3$ as a model perovskite, the authors compared spatial resolution, spectral fidelity, and artifact suppression across different scan modes. *Ptychographic phase reconstructions* consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position. In contrast, atomic-resolution *EELS maps* showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Finally, spiral scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in $BaTiO_3$ thin films improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions, establishing practical guidelines for programmable scan strategies in low-dose *4D-STEM* and highlighting the inherent resilience of ptychography to trajectory-induced artifacts.

- **Authors**: Debarghya Mallick, Sujoy Ghosh, An Hsi Chen, Qiangsheng Lu, Liam Collins, Sangsoo Kim, Gyula Eres, Ivan Kravchenko, Stephen Jesse, Steven J. Randolph, Scott T. Retterer, Matthew Brahlek, Robert G. Moore
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate an all-in-plane alternative for Josephson junctions (JJs) by "nanosculpting" ~100 nm-wide channels in thin films of $FeTe_{0.75}Se_{0.25}/Bi_2Te_3$ using a focused $Si^{++}$ ion beam (FIB).
- **Finding**: The researchers nanosculpted ~100 nm-wide channels into superconducting films using a $Si^{++}$ *focused ion beam (FIB)*. Systematic irradiation suppressed both the critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$), confirming the creation of a controllable weak link. *Kelvin probe force microscopy*, *atomic force microscopy*, and *scanning electron microscopy* corroborated the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region. $I_c(B)$ measurements revealed that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion. By tuning beam energy and dose, the process shifted from a superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) to a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SC-I-SC) geometry, establishing FIB patterning as a versatile platform for engineering robust, scalable fault-tolerant qubits.

**42. [Field-induced reversible phase transition and negative differential resistance in In2Se3 ferroelectric semiconducting FETs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09233v1)**
- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and understand gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in $In_2Se_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs).
- **Finding**: The authors observed gate-tunable NDR with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in $In_2Se_3$ FeS-FETs. Combining *high-resolution electron microscopy* with electrical transport measurements, they attributed the NDR to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. *Atomic scale ex-situ imaging* revealed that in-plane electric fields ($V_d$) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moire patterns), and intralayer shear, leading to stress-induced phase transitions. Out-of-plane fields, however, resulted in robust non-volatile polarization switching, highlighting both the promise of 2D ferroelectric devices for multifunctional nanoelectronics and alternative computing paradigms, and the intrinsic limitations of $In_2Se_3$ field-effect transistors for conventional ferroelectric memory applications.

**43. [Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497v1)**
- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: To study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide ($MoS_2$) nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and explain experimental observations of enhanced vibrations at edges.
- **Finding**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations revealed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes as nanoparticle edges were approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental *High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM)* observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained this phenomenon by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need for full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. The authors also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials to effectively capture interactions and enable accurate extrapolations of DFT calculations to larger systems.

**44. [Comparing Machine Learning and Physics-Based Nanoparticle Geometry Determinations Using Far-Field Spectral Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08174v1)**
- **Authors**: Mengqi Sun, Zixu Huang, Muammer Y. Yaman, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin, David S. Ginger
- **Date**: 2025-09-09
- **Objective**: To explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for determining the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) from far-field polarized dark-field scattering spectra and to compare its performance with physics-based analysis.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed a dual-branch multimodal VAE trained on paired polarized dark-field scattering spectra and *electron microscopy images* to predict Au NR geometries (orientational angle and aspect ratio) using only spectral input. The dual-VAE achieved good performance for orientational angle prediction (MAE of 14.4 and CCC of 0.95) with a small training set (300 particles), only marginally worse than the physics-based cos(2$\theta$) fitting approach. Aspect ratio determination was also comparable. By learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model could generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio, suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems.

Carter-Gartside, Alex Vanstone, Sandrine Heutz, Will R. Branford, Efrén Navarro-Moratalla, Johannes C. Lischner, Sarah Haigh, Cecilia Mattevi
- **Date**: 2025-09-09
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the tunable synthesis of different crystal phases (1T$'$ and 1T) of $CrS_2$ and $Cr_2S_3$ using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterize their magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: The authors successfully synthesized the previously unreported distorted octahedral (1T$'$) phase of $CrS_2$ via MOCVD, alongside the 1T phase, and characterized $Cr_2S_3$ with a Néel temperature of ~46 K. The phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and *4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction*. The 1T$'$ $CrS_2$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperatures. The *4DSTEM* characterization revealed that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation from the 1T to 1T$'$, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals, paving the way for scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for spintronics.

**46. [Direct determination of antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition pathways in PbZrO$_3$ with Operando Electron Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07194v1)**
- **Authors**: Menglin Zhu, Michael Xu, Louis Alaerts, Hao Pan, Colin Gilgenbach, Geoffroy Hautier, Lane W. Martin, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To directly resolve the atomic-scale mechanisms and phase transition pathways during the electric field-induced antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transformation in $PbZrO_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: The researchers employed *operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)* with electric field biasing to directly observe a multi-step antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in $PbZrO_3$ thin films, revealing several metastable phases. Complementary *nano-beam electron diffraction* and atomic scale analysis showed that this pathway and its end states could be modulated, leading to the formation of a "dead layer" near the substrate with suppressed switching behavior. Dynamic phase transformations were observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases at a transition front, driven by competing internal and external fields, providing key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions and guiding the design of antiferroelectric-based devices.

**47. [3D Mapping of Defects and Moiré Corrugations via Electron Ptychography Atomic Coordinate Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07140v1)**
- **Authors**: Jeffrey Huang, Yichao Zhang, Sang hyun Bae, Ballal Ahammed, Elif Ertekin, Pinshane Y. Huang
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To experimentally access and map out-of-plane deformations, defects, and moiré corrugations in 2D moiré materials, which strongly modify their electronic properties.
- **Finding**: The authors solved the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer $WSe_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy using *multislice electron ptychography (MEP)* acquired from a single orientation. The resulting atomic models individually visualized each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each $WSe_2$ layer, variations in the interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies, which were found exclusively in the outer Se planes. They also observed a new, unexpected type of structural disorder consisting of mixed bending- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations. This method generates 3D atom-by-atom models from data acquired in about 30 seconds, enabling routine access to 3D atomic information in 2D systems and catalyzing design methods to control out-of-plane deformations.

**48. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v2)**
- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior, specifically the hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging (3.8 mass ppm diffusible hydrogen) followed by slow strain tensile testing resulted in brittle fracture within the elastic regime. *Fractographic studies* indicated intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology at surface crack initiation. *Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM)* investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture, with *site-specific TEM* and *transmission Kikuchi diffraction* studies revealing {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. *Electron backscatter diffraction* studies on cross-sectional cracks further supported the hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen promotes decohesion and brittle fracture at high crack velocities, inhibiting crack blunting and ensuring sustained brittle crack growth even after hydrogen depletion at the crack tip.

**49. [Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166v1)**
- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: To investigate how dopants self-organize and how local structural short-range order is altered within amorphous interfacial complexions in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys.
- **Finding**: Using *high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)* and elemental analysis, the researchers observed chemical partitioning at both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region was found to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. Atomistic simulations with a custom machine learning interatomic potential revealed that increased grain boundary chemical complexity resulted in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure sensitive to dopant ratios. This work demonstrates the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions, opening avenues for microstructural engineering.

- **Date**: 2025-09-05
- **Objective**: To automate the reliable identification of weak- versus strong-beam conditions in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) for quantitative characterization of dislocations, addressing a critical bottleneck in the technique.
- **Finding**: The authors introduced a deep learning framework using a lightweight convolutional neural network trained on small, hand-labeled datasets to automate the classification of imaging conditions in *Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM)*. This approach enables robust, rapid, and scalable identification of weak-beam conditions, which enhance dislocation contrast, transforming DFXM into a high-throughput tool. This advancement unlocks statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials, overcoming the previous subjective, slow, and unscalable manual classification by specialists.
