- **Authors**: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To epitaxially grow 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001) and characterize their structural and electronic properties for integration with 3D semiconducting materials.

**30. [Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20930v1)**
- **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To understand and control the polarization direction and chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films by leveraging the interplay between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain.
- **Finding**: Anisotropic compressive strain promoted the formation of ferroelectric domains in BFO films despite the metallic buffer's tendency to stabilize uniform out-of-plane polarization. Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that the resulting nanoscale domain architecture was stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on oppositely polarized regions. This mechanism was leveraged to stabilize uniform out-of-plane polarization, and signatures of homochiral polarization textures were observed, opening pathways for functional domain-wall and domain-based electronics.

- **Authors**: Zanlin Cheng, Jiawen Zhang, Peng Gao, Guosong Zeng, Xufei Fang, Wenjun Lu
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To improve the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations through surface scratching.
- **Finding**: Surface scratching along the [100] direction effectively generated edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Through nanoindentation tests and microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it was revealed that these dislocations significantly mitigated the formation of cleavage cracks, facilitating stable plastic deformation and enhancing the material's toughness.

- **Authors**: Laura Niermann, Tore Niermann, Chengyu Song, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-08-26
- **Objective**: To present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM, based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects.

**34. [Atomistic Structure of Transient Switching States in Ferroelectric AlScN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18241v1)**
- **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced experimental techniques and simulations.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that broad transitional regions previously observed in STEM images are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, rather than a transient nonpolar intermediate phase. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging of partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films confirmed this, while large-scale molecular dynamics simulations revealed switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, consistent with experimental switching dynamics.

- **Authors**: Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the crystalline-to-crystalline phase transition between GeSe polymorphs induced by thermal annealing or localized laser heating.
- **Finding**: The highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe was found to transform into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation, exhibiting a high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to investigate the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface, revealing that the transition is driven by the clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase and the segregation of a minor GeSe$_2$ phase at elevated temperatures.

**36. [Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17085v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: To investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations within the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys.
- **Finding**: Shockley partial dislocations (a/6<112>) were observed to cross-slip from one $\{111\}$ plane to another $\{111\}$ conjugate plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterized defects and chemical fluctuations, revealing that elemental segregation reduces the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies. This mechanism, along with local stress concentrations, enhances the high-temperature deformation resistance of the alloy.

- **Objective**: To provide definitive evidence for the formation of single-variant altermagnetic RuO$_2$(101) thin films, crucial for realizing their potential in spintronic devices.
- **Finding**: Definitive evidence was presented for the formation of single-variant altermagnetic RuO$_2$(101) thin films with fully epitaxial growth on Al$_2$O$_3$(1-102) r-plane substrates. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for rigorous structural analyses, confirming the single-variant nature, which is attributed to the mutual correspondence of oxygen atom occupancy at the RuO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ interface. Spin-splitting magnetoresistance was further observed in single-variant RuO$_2$(101)/CoFeB bilayers, highlighting the characteristic effect on spin transport.

- **Finding**: The study shows through simulation that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can effectively measure dopant site occupancy. While differences in interaction range hinder purely measurement-based quantification, this challenge can be overcome by comparing experimental data with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors. This method leverages the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, offering a novel approach for determining dopant concentrations and site preferences.

A top-down fabrication process for Nb/Zr-ZrO$_x$/Nb Josephson junctions was developed. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experimentally revealed that ZrO$_x$ tunnel barriers can be fully crystalline tetragonal ZrO$_2$ with chemically abrupt interfaces with niobium, further confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Room temperature characterization showed a low tunnel barrier height, promising for merged-element transmon applications.

- **Date**: 2025-08-14
- **Objective**: To directly observe and understand the tunable transition from $\pi$ to $2\pi$ soliton lattices in the non-centrosymmetric Heusler compound Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn.
- **Finding**: The study identified a $\pi$-chiral soliton lattice (CSL) as the magnetic ground state in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn, which evolves into a classical $2\pi$-CSL under increasing out-of-plane magnetic fields. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (Lorentz TEM) was used for direct observation of this transition, revealing that it is governed by a delicate interplay between uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostatic interactions, as captured by a double sine-Gordon model. These findings establish a framework for understanding magnetic phase diagrams in chiral systems, with implications for spintronic devices.

**50. [Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942v1)**
- **Authors**: Vaibhav Choudhary, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Objective**: To improve feature localization in secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques by modeling the full distribution of SE counts as a mixture, rather than a convolution, in response to the incident beam's spatial profile.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that modeling the full distribution of SE counts as a mixture, under a plausible physical abstraction for the beam, enables significant resolution improvements over conventional estimators. For a stylized application in semiconductor inspection, a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) computed from time-resolved measurements (TRM) showed a 5-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) for edge localization compared to interpolation-based estimation, both in Monte Carlo simulations and when applied to three real helium ion microscopy (HIM) datasets. This work directly enhances the precision of secondary electron imaging techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and HIM.
