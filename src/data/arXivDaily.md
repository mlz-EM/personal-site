- **Date**: 2025-11-19
- **Objective**: To develop an atomically dispersed nickel-nitrogen-carbon ($\text{Ni-NC}$) catalyst integrated into a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) reactor for stable and efficient $\text{CO}_2$ electrolysis to CO.
- **Finding**: The $\text{Ni-NCNT}$ catalyst (using carbon nanotubes) achieved a high partial current density toward CO (558 $\text{mA cm}^{-2}$) and stable operation over 210 hours. **Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography** was crucial, providing 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers. Simulations based on these 3D images demonstrated that the superior performance of $\text{Ni-NCNT}$ compared to carbon black supports is due to improved $\text{CO}_2$ diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution.

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{N}$ thin films and correlate the magneto-transport properties with structural anisotropy.
- **Finding**: Tetragonal samples ($x=0.8$ and $1$) exhibit unusual two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects. **Electron microscopy** confirmed the co-existence of two crystallographic orientations ($c$-axis and $a$-axis normal to the film surface) in the tetragonal thin film. This structural anisotropy, combined with DFT results showing opposite signs for the anomalous effects along the $a$ and $c$ axes, explains the observed two-component magneto-transport behavior.

- **Authors**: Anand Ithepalli, Saumya Vashishtha, Naomi Pieczulewski, Qiao Liu, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Matthew Barone, Darrell Schlom, David A. Muller, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Objective**: To investigate how the miscut angle of $c$-plane sapphire substrates affects the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting properties of MBE-grown NbN thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle from $0.5^\circ$ to $10^\circ$ significantly improved the structural quality of the NbN films (rocking curve FWHM decreased from 76 arcsecs to 20 arcsecs). **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** images determined that the critical thickness for the onset of columnar growth is approximately $10\text{ nm}$, regardless of the substrate miscut. The improved structural quality correlated with a marginal increase in the superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) from $12.1\text{ K}$ to $12.5\text{ K}$.

- **Finding**: The presence of magnetism in the zGNR was initially confirmed by **scanning NV center microscopy**. Subsequent magneto-transport measurements on a transistor fabricated from the zGNR showed a large, highly anisotropic magnetoresistance ($\sim 175\ \Omega$ or $1.3\%$) that persists well above room temperature. These findings corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of the zGNR, stabilized by the h-BN embedding.

**39. [Mechanistic Transition from Screw to Edge Dislocation Glide Enhances High-Temperature Strength in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10869v1)**
- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism responsible for enhanced high-temperature strength in refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs), focusing on the transition of the controlling dislocation glide mechanism.
- **Finding**: Increasing the V content in the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system introduces substantial atomic misfit, which preferentially raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** was used to characterize the dislocation structures and microstructural evolution supporting this mechanistic transition.

- **Authors**: Yaozhu Li, Szilvia Kalácska, Phil McCausland, Roberta L. Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To perform a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the Martian meteorite NWA 7721 to determine if it preserves evidence of dynamic crustal deformation on Mars prior to impact.
- **Finding**: Analysis using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) and **electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)** revealed a bimodal microstructure: fine, strain-free Type 1 subgrains (shock recrystallization products) and coarse, strongly strained Type 2 subgrains (preserving the deformed parent grain). This bimodal structure provides the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves remnants of substantial crustal or magmatic stress (dynamic crustal deformation) experienced on Mars before the subsequent shock event.
