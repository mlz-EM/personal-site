- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that the phase selection of MnTe polymorphs can be programmed by InP substrate surface termination: the hexagonal NiAs-structure (altermagnetic) stabilizes on the (111)A surface, while the cubic ZnS-structure (non-centrosymmetric) stabilizes on the (111)B surface. Electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction collectively indicated that phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface, with first-principles calculations suggesting interfacial termination and strain as key factors.

- **Date**: 2025-07-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of the hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$, focusing on the interplay between short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order.
- **Finding**: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layers, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments directly demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, supporting this bond instability. Magnetic measurements confirmed long-range A-type antiferromagnetic order at $T_N = 4.5$ K with strong magnetic anisotropy. Interestingly, despite DFT predicting a semiconductor, the single crystal exhibited metallic conductivity with an anomaly at $T_N$, likely associated with the observed interstitial P atoms.

- **Date**: 2025-07-13
- **Objective**: To synthesize Bi-doped copper (Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$) nanowires (NWs) and investigate their structural properties and thermal stability, correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features for spintronic applications.
- **Finding**: Advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques were crucial in revealing the influence of synthesis conditions on the resulting NW crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or in grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. NWs with larger crystalline domains allowed homogeneous Bi incorporation, while smaller domains showed noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. Thermal stability analysis using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering showed lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice upon heating, followed by rhombohedral metallic Bi crystallization upon cooling.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to estimate the dispersion of WSe$_2$ hexagonal domain orientation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section was used to identify and verify the monolayer character of the film, complementing optical methods.

- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) of short-period Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN superlattices to achieve low-defect complex multilayers for quantum photonic devices, focusing on structural optimization and lattice-matching.
- **Finding**: X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping confirmed lattice-matching at $x = 0.14$ Sc composition, evidenced by symmetric superlattice satellites aligned in-plane with the underlying substrate peak. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigation of the Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor in setting the nitride composition variation and implicitly the band structure profile along the growth direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) further revealed that Sc incorporation exhibits delays relative to Al at both onset and termination, guiding optimal growth conditions.

- **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography was used to directly visualize polar displacements of transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite the conductive nature of RuO$_2$. This interfacial polarization enabled over 1 eV modulation of the RuO$_2$ work function, controlled by small thickness variations (2-4 nm) as measured by Kelvin probe microscopy, with a critical thickness of 4 nm corresponding to the transition from fully strained to relaxed film. These results establish interfacial polarization as a powerful route to control electronic properties in metals.

- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To study the dynamics of graphene etching in the van der Waals (vdW) gap by various molecules (O$_2$, H$_2$, and CO) using an inverted wedding-cake configuration of multilayer graphene on platinum, to identify kinetic limitations of such confined reactions.
- **Finding**: In situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to study the dynamics of graphene etching in the vdW gap. The experiments revealed that under the explored conditions, the etching reaction rates are limited by mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persisted even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting of the vdW gap. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further revealed multiple etching pathways for CO, enabled by confinement within the vdW space.

- **Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Objective**: To investigate the convergence properties of iterative electron ptychography methods, particularly under low electron doses, focusing on the impact of user-defined update strengths on reconstruction accuracy.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that carefully chosen, relatively small update strengths for both the object and probe are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential, especially under low electron doses ($<$ $10^3$ $e^-/Å^2$). Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_3$) sample, it was shown that convergence is practically achievable only when these update strengths are small. Additionally, under low doses, initial reconstruction error increases when update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold, emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which algorithms can be trapped in local minima.

The study observed transformations between the FeCl$_2$ and FeCl$_3$ phases and elucidated the role of defects in these transformations. Specifically, three types of defects were identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl$_2$ domains, and Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl$_3$ domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. The observation of a new crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe$_5$Cl$_{18}$ further advanced the understanding of 2D material intercalation mechanisms and the profound impact of atomic-scale defects.

- **Date**: 2025-07-07
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanistic insights into metal-support interactions in heterogeneous catalysts during redox reactions, specifically focusing on NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ catalysts during hydrogen oxidation.
- **Finding**: Operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized to uncover a novel type of "looping" metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ catalysts during hydrogen oxidation. It revealed that lattice oxygens at the NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ interfaces react with NiFe-activated H atoms, leading to gradual sacrifice and dynamically migrating interfaces. Simultaneously, reduced iron atoms migrate to the {111} surface of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support and react with oxygen molecules. This demonstrates a spatial separation of the hydrogen oxidation reaction on a single nanoparticle, intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support through dynamic migration of metal-support interfaces, providing previously unidentified atomic-scale mechanistic insight.

- **Date**: 2025-07-04
- **Objective**: To develop an automatic differentiation (AD)-based approach to achieve subpixel correction of diffraction pattern shifts in ptychography, thereby enhancing reconstruction robustness and image fidelity.
- **Finding**: The proposed method treats the cropping shift as an optimizable parameter within the reconstruction framework, integrating shift correction into the backpropagation loop. This allows simultaneous refinement of the object, probe, and shift positions without requiring manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrated that, even with initial offsets ranging up to 5 pixels, the method achieves subpixel correction, with an average deviation below 0.5 pixels. Experiments in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime further validated the method's robustness and effectiveness, enhancing the automation and robustness of ptychographic reconstructions.

- **Objective**: To investigate the specific role of $\Sigma$3(111) grain boundaries (GBs) in facilitating hydrogen insertion into palladium (Pd) nanostructures.
- **Finding**: In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed that Pd nanostructures enriched with well-defined $\Sigma$3(111) GBs exhibited dramatically accelerated hydriding and dehydriding kinetics compared to other Pd nanoparticles. Strain mapping using environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) showed that strain is highly localized at GBs and intensifies upon hydrogen exposure, indicating preferential hydrogen insertion along GB sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported these findings, showing that hydrogen insertion near $\Sigma$3(111) GBs is energetically more favorable and that tensile strain lowers insertion barriers.

- **Finding**: The study analyzed the evolution of actual electron wave packets and beams during inelastic diffraction scattering on finite-duration laser pulses. Results revealed coherent multiphoton exchange involving up to $10^4$ photons and the emergence of attosecond-zeptosecond electron sub-bunches after free-space propagation. This pulse compression mechanism is robust to laser pulse duration but sensitive to the initial momentum spread of the particles/beams. The proposed mechanism for achieving electron pulses in zeptosecond time scales offers potential for ultrafast coherent control of quantum states and opens new avenues in high-resolution temporal structuring of electron beams for time-resolved quantum technologies and attosecond-zeptosecond science, as well as high-resolution electron microscopy.

High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in STEM was used for feedback-controlled monitoring of structural evolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode HAADF images and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform that instructed FPGA-controlled beam for precise localized electron beam exposure, demonstrating a material-agnostic framework for creating diverse defect structures.

- **Authors**: Hao Geng, Qiaofei Pan, Jian Kang, Yiming Pan
- **Date**: 2025-07-01
- **Objective**: To propose a novel photon-induced pairing mechanism to generate a net attractive force between electrons in high-intensity ultrafast electron beams, aiming to mitigate space-charge interactions and enhance beam coherence.
- **Finding**: The study proposes a photon-induced pairing mechanism that generates a net attractive force between two electrons, forming "flying bound states" analogous to Cooper pairs. Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), it demonstrates that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability mediated by structured electromagnetic fields at near-resonant velocity matching regimes. This mechanism has the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, which can further enhance beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electrons.

- **Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the relationship between structural disorder and the establishment of superconducting phase coherence in a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB$_2$ nanocomposite.
- **Finding**: 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data showed that the complex MgO/MgB$_2$ microstructure spreads isotropically throughout the sample with a constant fractal dimension of ~$1.67$. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that the MgO/MgB$_2$ interfaces are atomically clean and free from amorphous grain boundaries, even leading to atomically coherent interfaces. Spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence measurements demonstrated that oxygen vacancies in the MgO-rich phase tend to aggregate near the MgO/MgB$_2$ boundary regions, forming long channels of oxygen vacancies that contribute to long-range carrier transfer and Andreev reflection via coherent tunneling, explaining the bulk-like superconducting properties despite the low MgB$_2$ volume fraction.
