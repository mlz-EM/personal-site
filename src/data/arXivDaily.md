**1. [Exploring phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals using liquid-phase TEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23588v1)**
- **Authors**: Olga Kaczmarczyk, Konrad Cyprych, Dominika Benkowska-Biernacka, Rafał Kowalczyk, Katarzyna Matczyszyn, Hanglong Wu, Frances M. Ross, Andrzej Miniewicz, Andrzej Żak
- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **Objective**: To perform *in situ* observations of phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM).
- **Finding**: LP-STEM enabled the direct, real-time observation of electron beam-induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic ($\mathrm{SmA}-\mathrm{N}$) and from nematic to isotropic ($\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{I}$). The kinetic dependence on dose rate was measured, and the findings, supported by heat diffusion calculations, suggest the phenomena are primarily thermal, demonstrating that nanoconfined 8CB has significantly different thermal properties than its bulk form.

- **Date**: 2025-12-22
- **Objective**: To introduce Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM), a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes the low spatial frequency contrast gap typical in linear phase-contrast STEM by fusing complementary scattering channels.
- **Finding**: FF-STEM combines ptychographic phase reconstruction (using bright-field data for high resolution) with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging (providing complementary low-frequency contrast) within a single 4D-STEM acquisition. The optimal fusion of these channels in Fourier space yields transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity, preserving the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography while enabling dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.

**19. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate how varying $\mathrm{Pt}/\mathrm{Ru}$ ratios in electrodeposited overlays influence the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of $\mathrm{NiCoCrAlYTa}$ coatings.

- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the effect of a scandium nitride ($\text{ScN}$) buffer layer on the superconducting properties of thin niobium nitride ($\text{NbN}$) films.
- **Finding**: The use of an $\text{ScN}$ buffer layer significantly improved the characteristics of 29 nm thick $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing the critical temperature $T_c$ from 9 K to 12.5 K and decreasing resistivity from $330 \text{ m}\Omega \cdot \text{cm}$ to $210 \text{ m}\Omega \cdot \text{cm}$. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that these enhancements are attributed to better lattice matching between $\text{NbN}$ and $\text{ScN}$, resulting in a higher quality $\text{NbN}$ crystal lattice.

**29. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: To report and investigate a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in ferroelectric $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ at room temperature.
- **Finding**: A strong magnetically coupled EO effect was observed, stemming from defect-bound unpaired electrons responsible for the problematic direct current drift. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) directly visualized that the magnetic-field-induced formation of room-temperature skyrmion states quenches the slow polarization relaxation of these defects. This collective spin ordering transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, significantly enhancing the EO efficiency (up to 34 pm/V in $\text{LiNbO}_3$).

**30. [Diamond crystal with Y-defects: spectroscopy and transmittion electron microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12278v1)**
- **Authors**: A. A. Shiryaev, E. F. Vasilev, A. L. Vasilev, V. V. Artemov, N. V. Gubanov, D. A. Zedgenizov
- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural defects and spectroscopic characteristics of a natural diamond containing Y-defects.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the Y-defect zone revealed the presence of dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects. Extended defects were observed as thin (1-3 nm) rhombic plates, which TEM contrast analysis identified as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) up to 20 nm in size. It is suggested that the unusual blinking behavior of photoluminescence lines observed upon laser excitation is due to recombination processes occurring at the internal walls of these discovered nanovoids.

- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between temperature and film thickness on ferroelastic domain wall (DW) morphology and dynamics in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with machine learning analysis, a distinct thickness-dependent thermal evolution was mapped. In the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm), DWs are mobile near $T_C$ and freeze upon cooling. Conversely, in the crossover regime (200-300 nm), DWs were found to be nearly static with curvature an order of magnitude lower, demonstrating how thickness governs the DW behavior across the super-elastic to freezing regimes.

**34. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform direct real-space imaging of ultrasmall nanometric skyrmion lattices using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) in Fresnel mode and analyze the limitations of conventional chiral discrimination methods.
- **Finding**: LTEM studies of skyrmion lattices in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon when analyzed using conventional methods. Through systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations, this misinterpretation was attributed to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function (CTF), which correlates with defocus values and ultrasmall skyrmion dimensions, establishing quantitative limitations for Fresnel contrast analysis at the nanoscale.

**35. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies (topological-Hall-like effect) in a $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures, such as skyrmions, which are typically associated with the topological Hall effect. The anomalies were instead attributed to trivial mechanisms, specifically the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels arising from sample inhomogeneity, demonstrating the difficulty of identifying chiral spin textures solely through transport measurements in bulk systems.

**36. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust, constraint-free phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) using untrained coordinate-based neural fields and a physics-consistent forward model.
- **Finding**: CDIP successfully eliminates the need for handcrafted, object-specific constraints in phase retrieval, a major limitation in CDI. The framework demonstrated superior fidelity and stability compared to classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines on simulated and experimental datasets, offering a broadly applicable paradigm shift for coherent imaging modalities, including electron ptychography and holography, crucial for atomic-resolution imaging of non-crystalline specimens.

**37. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings, including mechanisms for elongation, tilting, and collapse.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and simulations predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, eventually leading to rupture via bobber formation. *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) experiments on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed the strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary control mechanism.

**38. [Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09067v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of neural network segmentation models with respect to imaging conditions in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).
- **Finding**: By training and testing over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic HRTEM data, the study demonstrated that network performance smoothly and predictably worsens as imaging conditions shift away from the training distribution. The HRTEM Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) was successfully developed as a framework to compare information content and quantify OOD domain shifts, providing a crucial tool for reliable deployment of ML models in variable experimental TEM workflows.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the critical influence of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_u$) and magnetization in $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnet alloys.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed significant compressive strain, up to 25%, near grain boundaries in the $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys. Density functional theory calculations, informed by these STEM measurements, showed that while $K_u$ is positive (4.2 $\text{MJ/m}^3$) under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions subjected to 25% compressive strain, highlighting the detrimental effect of microstructural lattice distortions on magnetic performance.

- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence of optically active point defects (color centers) in Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond).
- **Finding**: A new photoluminescent defect, RU1, was identified in meteoritic Lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable emission (peak $\sim 700$ nm) with a 14 ns excited-state lifetime. Correlative electron microscopy was crucial in confirming the Lonsdaleite host lattice structure, suggesting that hexagonal diamond can serve as a new quantum-grade crystalline platform.

- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To manipulate and observe the reorientation of helical magnetic domains under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress using *in situ* techniques.
- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) allowed for the direct observation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) reorientation under stress. The process was found to be mediated by magnetic defects via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" mechanisms, demonstrating that strain engineering provides an energy-efficient route for nanophase control in magnetic systems.

**42. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the formation and control of surface spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) and establish the phase factor $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed the emergence of SSs adjacent to FCIs. LTEM specifically revealed SS formation at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, demonstrating that the intrinsic in-plane directionality ($\phi_0$) controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of these spirals, enabling potential multi-state spintronic functionalities.

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox concerning the synthesizability of metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: The paradox was resolved by showing that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier. Electron microscopy (EM) and *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction were used to directly visualize the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation, validating the size-dependent stabilization mechanism.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) above 60 K in epitaxial nickelate thin films.
- **Finding**: Ambient-pressure superconductivity onset was achieved at $\sim 63$ K in epitaxial $(\text{La,Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium method. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity and high quality necessary for stabilizing this metastable, high-$T_c$ phase. The enhanced superconductivity is linked to strange-metal-like behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$) and significantly strong interlayer coupling, identifying nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-$T_c$ system.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) pipeline for denoising low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and out-of-distribution (OOD) time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images.
- **Finding**: A blind-spot convolutional neural network pipeline was developed that significantly outperforms existing ML and non-ML methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features in HRTEM. Crucially, the model is computationally fast (inference speed in milliseconds) and demonstrates excellent OOD generalization, making it suitable for real-time application in *in situ* HRTEM experiments under low electron dosage.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To resolve structural transitions and delineate the temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2-\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ lanthanide high entropy oxides (HEOs).
- **Finding**: A comprehensive phase diagram was constructed, identifying stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, as part of a multi-length-scale characterization suite, was critical for quantifying the crystal structure and identifying boundaries between these closely related phases, showing that non-equilibrium synthesis can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase with a high concentration of oxygen sublattice vacancies (16.7%).

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ thin films through interfacial engineering with various perovskite oxide layers.
- **Finding**: Interfacial engineering successfully tuned the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy from partial $d^7$ to partial $d^5$. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed the structural details at the interface and established a clear connection between interfacial strain and the resulting Co spin configuration, demonstrating that the interfacial environment simultaneously governs both orbital occupancy and spin state in correlated oxides.

- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize a new class of hexagonal $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions using high pressure and temperature methods.
- **Finding**: By subjecting Ge and Sn to pressures up to 10 GPa and high temperatures, ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions was achieved. Precession electron diffraction (PED) and chemical analysis using electron microscopy confirmed the crystal symmetry and correlated the formation of the hexagonal phase to Sn uptake (below 21 atom % Sn), opening new routes for tuning optoelectronic properties based on crystal symmetry and stacking sequence.

**49. [On the relation between microstructure and impact toughness of 17-4__PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14702v1)**
- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of aging heat treatments on the microstructure and the resulting quasi-static and dynamic mechanical behavior (impact toughness) of 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by PBF-LB.
- **Finding**: PBF-LB specimens exhibited high tensile strength but consistently low impact toughness. Multiscale characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions, originating from the powder, as detrimental nucleation sites for micro-cavities. TEM further showed that the distribution of $\text{Cu}$-rich nanoprecipitates controls the pronounced strength-toughness trade-off via Orowan strengthening versus local plasticity enhancement.

**50. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters—probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism—on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations confirmed that DPC-STEM measurements are highly vulnerable to instrumental variations. Probe defocus significantly underestimated the electrostatic field magnitude (up to 30% for a 30 mrad probe). Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations exceeding 40% for small magnitudes, underscoring the critical need for optimized instrumental alignment to ensure accurate CoM-based STEM imaging of atomic-scale electric fields.
