**1. [Improvement of H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16871v1)**
- **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Vanessa S. Antonin, Caio Machado Fernandes, Liying Liu, Mauro C. Santos

- **Objective**: To investigate the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$ as electrocatalysts for improving H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
- **Finding**: The study found that Vulcan XC72 carbon modified with Nb$_2$O$_5$ doped with 0.5% Ce showed the highest electrocatalytic response for H$_2$O$_2$ production. Electron microscopy techniques, specifically Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), were employed to characterize the morphology and structure of the electrocatalysts, contributing to the understanding of how Ce doping influences the material properties and performance.
