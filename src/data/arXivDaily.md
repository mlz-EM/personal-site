- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and the mechanism of hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.

- **Finding**: Through simulation, the study showed that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure dopant site occupancy by leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy. The interpretation strategy is similar to that used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. While differences in interaction ranges hinder purely measurement-based quantification, this can be overcome by comparison with simulations that generalize Cliff-Lorimer k-factors, establishing a robust electron microscopy method for dopant analysis.

**37. [Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942v1)**
- **Authors**: Vaibhav Choudhary, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that a more detailed physical abstraction of the incident beam's spatial profile as a mixture, rather than a convolution, can enable resolution improvements in secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques.

- **Authors**: Yining Xie, Eoin Moynihan, Marin Alexe, Louis Piper, Ana Sanchez, Richard Beanland
- **Date**: 2025-08-08
- **Objective**: To present a new analysis method, "template masks," for atomic resolution four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to improve feature localization and enable imaging of specific atom columns.
- **Finding**: The new method applies an image (template) to 4D-STEM data to obtain a mask, which shows the correlation between the data and the template.
