- **Authors**: Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Wei Lv, Xianfeng Wu, Guangdi Zhou, Zihao Nie, Yueying Li, Cui Ding, Danfeng Li, Hongtao Yuan, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To achieve continuous control over the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in infinite-layer nickelates using an operando monitored reduction method.
- **Finding**: The SIT was driven by modulating the Ni 3$d$ orbital occupancy, which was calibrated using synchrotron XAS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms. The results suggest that the SIT in nickelates deviates from the canonical 2D model, involving a mixture of 2D and 3D superconducting characters.
