**34. [Anisotropy at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ ($R$=rare earth, $T$=transition metal) magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07724v1)**
- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: To determine the intrinsic magnetic properties, specifically anisotropy, at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ magnets using first-principles calculations, informed by high-resolution electron microscopy images.
- **Finding**: First-principles calculations, based on density-functional theory, were used to determine magnetic properties for two model interface structures derived from recently reported high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images. HREM provided unprecedented insight into the atomistic scale structure of these materials, which was then used to model twin and stacking fault interfaces. The calculations revealed that these interfaces modify magnetic properties at the sub-nanometer scale, with the local easy axis of magnetization rotating by $49^\circ$ in the R-rich region of a stacking fault, potentially reducing coercivity.

- **Authors**: Qing Cheng, Sergey V. Erohin, Konstantin V. Larionov, Bin Gan, Pavel B. Sorokin, Xiandong Xu
- **Date**: 2025-08-09
- **Objective**: To identify the key mechanism behind the intrinsic brittleness of single crystal iridium.
- **Finding**: The study identified high-density, sessile Frank dislocation loops with zero-net Burgers vectors as the key mechanism for iridium's brittleness. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was combined with density first-principles calculations and discrete dislocation dynamics simulations to reveal that these loops form via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed perfect dislocations under stress, a process unique to iridium among face-centered cubic metals. These immobile loops act as potent barriers, drastically increasing yield strength and work hardening by impeding dislocation glide.

- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, specifically La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.
- **Finding**: Using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), the study investigated structural and electronic properties of La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$. Electron microscopy techniques revealed that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown superconducting samples. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induced a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers that ultimately suppressed superconductivity, highlighting a competition between oxygen order and superconductivity distinct from cuprates.

- **Authors**: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: To directly measure the premixed phase at the interfaces of sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which are known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial for this direct measurement, revealing the crystallinity of the observed phase. The FCC phase retained its symmetry after annealing, with lattice parameter shifts consistent with an Al-rich composition, attributing its existence to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals, particularly focusing on local inversion symmetry breaking, the presence of topological spin textures, and the nature of its magnetic ground state.
- **Finding**: Through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, the study showed that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking despite maintaining global inversion symmetry, providing a convincing explanation for the observed Néel skyrmions via Lorentz-TEM. Magnetization measurements revealed a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase transition to a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, challenging previous claims of a glassy magnetic state. The clear correlation between skyrmion density hysteresis and magnetization further indicated that topological spin textures are affected by ferrimagnetism, with magnetic force microscopy (MFM) showing magnetic bubbles at the phase boundary.
