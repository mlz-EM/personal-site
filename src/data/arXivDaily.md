- **Authors**: Hossein Mirdamadi, Jiří David, Rui Wang, Tianle Jiang, Yanming Wang, Karel Vařeka, Michal Dymáček, Petr Bábor, Tomáš Šikola, Miroslav Kolíbal
- **Date**: 2025-07-10

**50. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: To explore the atomic number (Z) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and identify approaches to optimize Z sensitivity.
