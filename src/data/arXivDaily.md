**13. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: To explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and identify approaches to optimize $Z$ sensitivity.
- **Finding**: The study showed that **electron ptychography's** $Z$-dependence is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column. A monotonic $Z$-dependence is found for small integration areas, while larger areas lead to non-monotonic $Z$-contrast following orbital shell-structure trends. This non-monotonic behavior is useful for accentuating contrast between elements differing by only a single atomic number (e.g., $\beta$-CuZn, $Z = 29$ and $30$) even in thick samples ($>20$ nm), demonstrating how integration area can optimize ptychographic $Z$-contrast.

- **Authors**: E. R. Cardozo de Oliveira, C. Xiang, C. Borrazás, S. Sandeep, J. E. Gómez, M. Vásquez Mansilla, N. Findling, L. Largeau, N. D. Lanzillotti-Kimura, M. Granada
- **Date**: 2025-05-25
- **Objective**: Characterize the structural, magnetic, and nanoacoustic properties of nanometric Co/Pt superlattices to explore their potential for THz nanoacoustic devices.
- **Finding**: Co/Pt superlattices exhibited well-defined periodicity by X-ray reflectometry, but scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with local compositional analysis revealed a compositional modulation rather than sharp interfaces, and both X-ray diffraction and TEM confirmed their polycrystalline nature. Magnetization measurements showed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for higher Co concentrations, and picosecond acoustic experiments demonstrated the superlattices support short-lived acoustic modes up to 900 GHz, making them promising for ultrahigh-frequency magnetoacoustic devices.

**33. [Effect of Fluorine doping on the electrocatalytic properties of Nb2O5 for H2O2 electrogeneration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18140v1)**
- **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Caio Machado Fernandes, Mauro C. Santos
- **Date**: 2025-05-23
- **Objective**: Investigate the effect of fluorine (F) doping on the electrocatalytic properties of $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$ nanoparticles supported on Vulcan XC72 carbon for efficient $\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ electrogeneration via the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
- **Finding**: F-doped $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$ nanoparticles incorporated into Vulcan XC72 carbon were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), among other techniques. The study found that Vulcan XC72 modified with 1.0% F-doped $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$ exhibited the best ORR performance, producing significantly higher $\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ yields (65% and 98% higher at -0.7 V and -1.3 V, respectively) compared to undoped $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$. This enhanced performance is attributed to F doping-induced lattice distortion and disorder in $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$, improving electron availability, increasing oxygenated species, and enhancing hydrophilicity, which collectively facilitate $\mathrm{O_2}$ adsorption, transport, and electron transfer.

- **Authors**: Varun Ajith, Anindya Pal, Saumik Bhattacharya, Sayantari Ghosh
- **Date**: 2025-05-23
- **Objective**: Develop F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system, to generate realistic synthetic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanoparticles from segmentation maps, addressing the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets for nanomaterial analysis.
- **Finding**: The F-ANcGAN architecture, utilizing a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network with self-attention, successfully generated realistic synthetic SEM images of nanoparticles. The model achieved a raw FID score of 17.65 for $\mathrm{TiO_2}$ dataset generation, further reduced to nearly 10.39 with post-processing, demonstrating its capability to produce high-fidelity synthetic datasets. This approach can alleviate data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, improving the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training.

**35. [Improvement of H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16871v1)**
- **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Vanessa S. Antonin, Caio Machado Fernandes, Liying Liu, Mauro C. Santos
- **Date**: 2025-05-22
- **Objective**: Investigate the improvement of $\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ electrogeneration via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$.
- **Finding**: The study found that $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$ doped with 0.5% Ce, when used as an electrocatalyst on Vulcan XC72 carbon, significantly enhanced $\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ production. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the morphology and dispersion of the nanoparticles. This improvement is attributed to local distortions in the $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$ crystal lattice induced by Ce doping, combined with increased hydrophilicity and wetting properties, which facilitate electron transfer and $\mathrm{O_2}$ transport, leading to 105% and 86% more $\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ production at -1.3 V and -1.9 V, respectively, compared to undoped $\mathrm{Nb_2O_5}$.

- **Authors**: Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-05-20
- **Objective**: Introduce "phaser", an open-source Python package designed to provide a unified, modular, and computationally efficient platform for both conventional and gradient descent-based electron ptychographic reconstruction algorithms.
- **Finding**: The "phaser" package offers a unified interface for electron ptychography, supporting multiple computational backends and enabling faster reconstructions with improved quality, especially with the JAX backend which achieved a 6x improvement in iteration speed over existing state-of-the-art software. While the paper focuses on software development, it implicitly supports the use of electron microscopy data (e.g., 4D-STEM) by providing tools for robust reconstruction of phase images from raw data, essential for advanced materials characterization.

**37. [Atomic Topology and Magnetic Microstructure of Highly Mobile Type I and Supermobile Type II Twin Boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga Single Crystal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14096v1)**
- **Authors**: Ladislav Straka, Marek Vronka, Jan Maňák, Petr Veřtát, Hanuš Seiner, Oleg Heczko
- **Date**: 2025-05-20
- **Objective**: Investigate the atomic topology and magnetic microstructure of individual, highly mobile Type I and supermobile Type II twin boundaries in 10M Ni-Mn-Ga martensite single crystals using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed that both Type I and Type II twin boundaries are atomically sharp, with Type I oriented along the rational (101) plane and Type II having occasional single-atomic-plane steps, contrary to previous suggestions of its diffuse nature. Lorentz TEM revealed 180$^\circ$ domain walls within martensite variants and showed that magnetic induction reorients sharply across both twin boundaries, forming 90$^\circ$-like magnetic domain walls that follow the easy-magnetization direction.

**38. [Revealing Information from Weak Signal in Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy with a Deep Denoiser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14032v1)**
- **Authors**: Yifan Wang, Mai Tan, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Peter A. Crozier
- **Date**: 2025-05-20
- **Objective**: Develop and demonstrate a deep learning-based denoiser, the unsupervised deep video denoiser (UDVD), to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) datasets acquired with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), particularly for weak signals.
- **Finding**: The UDVD, a CNN-based denoiser, was adapted for EELS spectral series acquired with direct electron detectors, significantly improving signal quality. The study identified and proposed adjustments to suppress artifacts caused by charge spreading at pixel interfaces on direct electron detectors. Its effectiveness was demonstrated on challenging real-world STEM-EELS data, enabling clear mapping of Gd dopants in $\mathrm{CeO_2}$ nanoparticles and atomic-resolution characterization of vibrational modes in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which were previously obscured by noise.

**39. [Unifying Strain-driven and Pressure-driven Superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: Suppressed charge/spin density waves and enhanced interlayer coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12733v1)**
- **Authors**: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: Elucidate the critical factors that bridge strain-driven and pressure-driven superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ by analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics using density functional theory calculations.
- **Finding**: Density functional theory calculations, consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations, revealed an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at -0.9% compressive strain, preceding superconductivity. Compressive strain was found to lower Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels and suppress both charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities, analogous to pressure effects. The enhanced interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling ($J_\perp$) under both strain and pressure closely tracked the experimental superconducting $T_c$ variation, indicating that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_\perp$ are crucial for superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$.

- **Authors**: Bo Hao, Maosen Wang, Wenjie Sun, Yang Yang, Zhangwen Mao, Shengjun Yan, Haoying Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Lu Han, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dianxiang Ji, Yuefeng Nie
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: Investigate the superconductivity and establish the phase diagram of $\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$-doped $\mathrm{La_{3-x}Sr_{x}Ni_2O_7}$ thin films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing.
- **Finding**: The study successfully synthesized $\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$-doped $\mathrm{La_{3-x}Sr_{x}Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, revealing an asymmetric dome-like superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) profile with optimal $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$42 K at $x = 0.09$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar $\mathrm{NiO_2}$ sites, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples, due to Coulomb repulsion under compressive strain. Additionally, elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, observed by STEM, are suggested to weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films compared to bulk.

- **Authors**: Jongwoo Ha, Minah Choi, Jieun Yang, Chinkyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-05-16
- **Objective**: Develop a scalable thru-hole epitaxy (THE) method for localized, defect-suppressed GaN growth using self-adjusting hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) masks formed by solution-processed 2D stacks.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated a scalable thru-hole epitaxy (THE) method where GaN domains grow vertically and laterally through a spin-coated, solution-processed stack of $h$-BN flakes. Comprehensive structural analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the epitaxial growth of GaN beneath the $h$-BN mask and the suppression of threading dislocations. The disordered $h$-BN mask self-adjusts during growth, allowing precursor transport and coherent GaN nucleation, eliminating the need for patterned 2D mask transfers and offering a scalable route for selective-area GaN growth.

- **Date**: 2025-05-16
- **Objective**: Reveal and characterize the presence of a previously unreported polar phase of $\mathrm{WO_3}$ stabilized in thin films by epitaxial strain on $\mathrm{YAlO_3}$ substrates.
- **Finding**: The study successfully stabilized a triclinic polar phase of $\mathrm{WO_3}$ in thin films grown on $\mathrm{YAlO_3}$ substrates due to epitaxial strain. Large-scale reciprocal space mapping fully determined the unit cell, and unconventional strain accommodation mechanisms allowed stabilization up to unexpectedly large film thicknesses. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations of strain gradients around domain walls and local variations of octahedral tilts provided insights into this behavior. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) maps, along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), evidenced the polar nature and local conductivity modulations, opening possibilities for new functionalities in $\mathrm{WO_3}$-based devices.

- **Date**: 2025-05-14
- **Objective**: Investigate atomic-scale control over structural modulations in quasi-1D chalcogenides, specifically $\mathrm{Sr_xTiS_3}$ compounds, to tune their optical properties and enhance colossal optical anisotropy.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated compositional tunability of optical properties in $\mathrm{Sr_xTiS_3}$ compounds, with a predicted maximum birefringence of 2.5 for $\mathrm{Sr_{1.143}TiS_3}$ due to an indirect-to-direct band gap transition and increased $\mathrm{Ti}-d_{z^2}$ states. Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the feasibility of synthesizing $\mathrm{Sr_xTiS_3}$ with varied modulation periodicities, arising from different stacking sequences of $\mathrm{TiS_6}$ octahedra and twisted trigonal prisms, which are thermodynamically stable for $1 < x < 1.5$.

- **Authors**: Songge Li, Nicolas Gauquelin, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Arno Annys, Chuang Gao, Christoph Hofer, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
- **Date**: 2025-05-14
- **Objective**: Propose and validate strategies to improve the accuracy and robustness of aberration correction in single sideband (SSB) analytical electron ptychography, particularly under low-dose conditions where noise sensitivity and phase unwrapping issues are prominent.
- **Finding**: The authors proposed two strategies to enhance aberration correction in low-dose SSB ptychography: confining phase unwrapping within sidebands and selecting only well-unwrapped sidebands for aberration coefficient calculation. These strategies were validated through SSB reconstructions of simulated and experimental 4D-STEM datasets of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\mathrm{WSe_2}$). The results demonstrated significant improvements in Poisson noise tolerance, making aberration correction more robust and reliable for low-dose imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy.

**45. [Imaging domain boundaries of rubrene thin crystallites by photoemission electron microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09389v1)**
- **Authors**: Moha Naeimi, Katharina Engster, Waqas Pervez, Ingo Barke, Sylvia Speller
- **Date**: 2025-05-14
- **Objective**: Image and spectroscopically study domain boundaries in rubrene ($\mathrm{C_{48}H_{24}}$) thin crystallites using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopy to understand the interplay between photoemission processes, crystal morphology, and defect states.
- **Finding**: Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) images revealed distinct photoemission behaviors in rubrene thin crystallites. In a 2-photon photoemission (2PPE) process, dominant emission was localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states. In contrast, 1-photon photoemission (1PPE) showed uniform emission across the crystal surface. The study also identified a nonlinear, non-integer photon order in the intermediate photon energy range, where triclinic morphology primarily contributed to emission, distinguishing it from the orthorhombic phase, providing a new framework for assessing organic semiconductor thin film quality and internal structure.

- **Date**: 2025-05-13
- **Objective**: Investigate the structure and migration of twin boundaries in tetragonal $\beta$-Sn using atomistic simulations with machine learning-based interatomic potentials, and compare the results with experimental high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of deformation twins in $\beta$-Sn were compared with atomistic simulations using newly developed machine learning-based interatomic potentials (Moment Tensor Potential and Rapid Artificial Neural Network). The ML potentials yielded results consistent with experimental data, revealing faceted twin boundary structures formed by the nucleation and motion of twinning disconnections. The study identified low-energy asymmetric Prismatic-A-plane (PA/AP) interfaces, analogous to Prismatic-Basal interfaces in HCP metals, which are crucial for twin growth in $\beta$-Sn.

- **Date**: 2025-05-13
- **Objective**: Develop and evaluate a workflow based on total variation (TV) for image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images, addressing the presence of noise and unwanted signals in experimentally acquired data from various techniques.
- **Finding**: The study successfully applied total variation (TV)-based methods (TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$) for image decomposition and denoising across various microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible, while TGV-$L^1$ was most suitable for denoising. The approach effectively extracted unwanted signal components or denoised raw images, improving quality and revealing relevant features, and the Python code is publicly available for integration into experimental workflows.

- **Authors**: Chia-Hao Lee, Steven E. Zeltmann, Dasol Yoon, Desheng Ma, David A. Muller
- **Date**: 2025-05-12
- **Objective**: Introduce PtyRAD, an open-source, high-performance, and flexible software framework for electron ptychographic reconstruction that leverages automatic differentiation for multi-parameter optimization and streamlines hyperparameter selection.
- **Finding**: PtyRAD, an open-source software framework, provides a comprehensive and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. By utilizing PyTorch's optimized tensor operations and automatic differentiation (AD), PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. It enables seamless optimization of multiple parameters (e.g., sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions) and integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow for hyperparameter selection. The framework also proposes a real-space depth regularization to avoid wrap-around artifacts, beneficial for twisted 2D materials and vertical heterostructures, enhancing the utility of electron microscopy data.

- **Date**: 2025-05-12
- **Objective**: Optimize a flux method for growing large single crystals of the quantum spin liquid candidate $\mathrm{NdTa_7O_{19}}$ and other rare-earth heptatantalates ($\mathrm{ErTa_7O_{19}}$, $\mathrm{GdTa_7O_{19}}$) for comprehensive magnetic characterization.
- **Finding**: The study successfully grew large, high-quality single crystals of $\mathrm{NdTa_7O_{19}}$ (up to 3.5 mm lateral size) using a $\mathrm{K_2Mo_3O_{10}-B_2O_3}$ flux. The chemical composition and morphology were confirmed by powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed substantial magnetic anisotropy in $\mathrm{NdTa_7O_{19}}$ and isostructural $\mathrm{ErTa_7O_{19}}$ without long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, consistent with a potential exotic magnetic ground state, while $\mathrm{GdTa_7O_{19}}$ showed paramagnetic behavior.

- **Authors**: Shian Xia, Yan Luo, Iftikhar Ahmed Malik, Xinyi Zhou, Keying Han, Yue Sun, Haoyun Lin, Hanqing Shi, Yingchun Cheng, Vanessa Li Zhang, Yi Du, Sheng Liu, Chao Zhu, Ting Yu
- **Date**: 2025-05-11
- **Objective**: Investigate the spontaneous enhancement mechanism of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic ternary tellurides, specifically $\mathrm{Fe_3GaTe_2}$ (FGaT) and $\mathrm{Fe_3GeTe_2}$ (FGeT), driven by field-cooling-induced interface engineering.
- **Finding**: The study discovered a spontaneous Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) enhancement mechanism in $\mathrm{Fe_3GaTe_2}$ (FGaT) and $\mathrm{Fe_3GeTe_2}$ (FGeT) induced by field-cooling. Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the irreversible precipitation of $\mathrm{FeTe_2}$ in annealed FGaT was observed, forming $\mathrm{FeTe_2}$/FGaT heterostructures. This precipitation is considered to break symmetry and significantly enhance DMI, with similar phenomena noted in FGeT. The variation of $\mathrm{FeTe_2}$ precipitation with FGaT thickness aligns with reported skyrmion behavior, providing new insights into DMI origins in ternary tellurides for spintronic applications.
