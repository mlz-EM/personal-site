**38. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: To explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and develop approaches to optimize its $Z$ sensitivity.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that the $Z$-dependence of multislice electron ptychography is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column considered, with a small integration area yielding monotonic $Z$-dependence and larger areas revealing non-monotonic behavior linked to orbital shell-structure. This non-monotonic $Z$-dependence can be exploited to accentuate contrast between elements differing by only a single atomic number, even in thick samples ($> 20 \,nm$), as demonstrated for $\beta$-CuZn. Electron ptychography, a high-resolution electron microscopy technique, is shown to be a powerful tool for distinguishing elements based on their atomic number, offering tunable contrast for specific applications.
