- **Authors**: Kaveh Edalati, Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jimenez, Thanh Tam Nguyen
- **Date**: 2026-01-29
- **Objective**: To simulate the extreme conditions of astronomical impacts using high-pressure torsion (HPT) and study the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP).

High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was used to experimentally confirm these stacking-dependent stripe widths, validating the theoretical models of lattice relaxation.

Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to reveal the degree of Ta/Si intermixing at the interface, which was found to correlate with microwave performance and loss mechanisms.
