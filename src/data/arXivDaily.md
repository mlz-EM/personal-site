-   **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
-   **Date**: 2025-09-15
-   **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and ptychography phase imaging using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).

-   **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
-   **Date**: 2025-09-12
-   **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
-   **Finding**: Ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position, while atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Spiral scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in $\ce{BaTiO3}$ thin films improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions, establishing practical guidelines for programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM.

-   **Authors**: Debarghya Mallick, Sujoy Ghosh, An Hsi Chen, Qiangsheng Lu, Liam Collins, Sangsoo Kim, Gyula Eres, Ivan Kravchenko, Stephen Jesse, Steven J. Randolph, Scott T. Retterer, Matthew Brahlek, Robert G. Moore
-   **Date**: 2025-09-12
-   **Objective**: To demonstrate the fabrication of all-in-plane superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak link junctions by "nanosculpting" channels in $\ce{FeTe_{0.75}Se_{0.25}/Bi2Te3}$ thin films using a $\ce{Si^{++}}$ focused ion beam (FIB).
-   **Finding**: Focused ion beam (FIB) patterning successfully created $\sim 100\,\mathrm{nm}$-wide channels, progressively suppressing critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) and critical current ($I_\mathrm{c}$) with increasing ion dose, confirming controllable weak link formation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) corroborated the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region, and $I_\mathrm{c}(B)$ measurements revealed that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion and associated dissipation.

-   **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
-   **Date**: 2025-09-11
-   **Objective**: To demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and investigate the underlying mechanisms in $\ce{In2Se3}$ ferroelectric semiconducting field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs).
-   **Finding**: The authors observed gate-tunable NDR with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in $\ce{In2Se3}$ FeS-FETs, attributing it to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. High-resolution electron microscopy provided atomic-scale ex-situ imaging, revealing that in-plane electric fields ($V_\mathrm{d}$) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments, and intralayer shear, leading to stress-induced phase transitions.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To solve the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer $\ce{WSe2}$ with picometer-scale accuracy to visualize defects and moiré corrugations.
-   **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation enabled the solution of 3D atomic coordinates in twisted bilayer $\ce{WSe2}$ with picometer accuracy, visualizing each of the six atomic planes. The resulting atomic models revealed the curvature of each $\ce{WSe2}$ layer, variations in interlayer spacing, 3D locations of individual vacancies (exclusively in outer Se planes), and a new type of structural disorder consisting of mixed bending- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations.

-   **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and underlying mechanisms in a $1.5\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
