**26. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties in $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as a function of $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness, particularly near the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and other structural data revealed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when the $\text{Fe}$ thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) dropped below $30$ Å. Transport measurements showed a clear divergence in longitudinal resistivity ($\rho$) and anomalous Hall resistivity ($\rho_{A,h,s}$) near this threshold. The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) scaling analysis showed a crossover from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump mechanism ($n \sim 1.42$) in thick films to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism ($n = 0.62$) in high-resistive, percolative films, correlating directly with the microstructural connectivity established by HRTEM.

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To employ X-ray linear dichroism (XLD) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) to provide clear evidence regarding the presence or absence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ films, a candidate for altermagnetism.
- **Finding**: The XLD signal observed was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field direction, strongly suggesting a nonmagnetic origin for $\text{RuO}_2$, in stark contrast to predictions for substantial magnetic order. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) was used in conjunction with XLD to characterize the films. Furthermore, distinct XLD signals observed at the $\text{Ru } M_3$ and $\text{O } K$ edges were attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field rather than magnetic ordering.

**33. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\alpha$-Mn precipitate size and volume fraction in an ultrafine-grained $\text{Mg}-1.35 \text{wt.}\% \text{Mn}$ alloy during high-pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature.
- **Finding**: The volume fraction of nm-scale $\alpha$-Mn particles increased with applied strain, but Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated that the majority of manganese remained in solution. Analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that the mean particle size did not increase during HPT. This observation suggested that precipitate growth was limited by interfacial control rather than diffusional control under these extreme deformation conditions.

- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To quantify the influence of residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity, propagating from the virtual substrate, on the interface structure and potential qubit properties in $\text{s-Si}/\text{Si}_{0.7}\text{Ge}_{0.3}$ heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Spatially-aligned images of strain (Raman) and interface structure (AFM, X-STEM) revealed a strong strain-roughness interplay. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (X-STEM) provided direct visualization of the interface structure. Modeling indicated that the measured strains could cause spurious double-dot qubit detunings of $0.1$ meV over $100$ nm distances, suggesting that thicker virtual substrate buffer layers and lower growth temperatures are needed to limit roughening.

**35. [Layered $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$ with $\text{Cr}$ Kagome Lattice and Antiferromagnetic Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05360v1)**
- **Authors**: Jeremy G. Philbrick, Chaoguo Wang, Xin Gui, Tai Kong
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a new layered material, $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$.
- **Finding**: $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$ crystallizes in the $R\bar{3}m$ space group, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms sandwiched between disordered $\text{Ge-Se}$ layers. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the layered structure. The compound displays antiferromagnetic order below $50$ K, contrasting with the ferromagnetic behavior found in the related compound $\text{CrGeTe}_3$, and $\text{Cr}$ exhibits an effective moment consistent with the $\text{Cr}^{3+}$ oxidation state.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analysis of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries ($\text{GBs}$) in $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}$-capped $\text{Nb}$ thin films relevant to superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed significant oxygen segregation at $\text{GBs}$ in both $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}/\text{Nb}$ films, with segregation levels correlating positively with the oxygen concentration within the grains. The $\text{Ta}$ capping layer slightly reduced the oxygen enrichment factor in $\text{Nb}$ $\text{GBs}$ (from $2.7$ to $2.3$). Crucially, increases in oxygen concentration in both $\text{Nb}$ grains and $\text{GBs}$ correlated with a suppression of the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), providing atomic-scale insight into a potential decoherence mechanism.

- **Authors**: Arthur Niedermayr, Jianyu Wu, Bertina Fisher, Ido Kaminer, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To directly probe the spatiotemporal propagation and strain dynamics during a laser-excited phase transition in vanadium dioxide ($\text{VO}_2$) using ultrafast four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM).
- **Finding**: Ultrafast 4D STEM successfully enabled virtual imaging and strain mapping at every point in space and time, directly recording the spatiotemporal propagation of the insulator-metal transition in $\text{VO}_2$. This direct imaging capability connected atomic-scale symmetry breaking to the resulting lattice distortions and strain formation on picosecond timescales, providing new insights into the coupling between electronic, structural, and mechanical responses in correlated oxides.

- **Authors**: Louis Alaerts, Jesse Schimpf, Xinyan Li, Jiongzhi Zheng, Ella Banyas, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Sinéad M. Griffin, Yimo Han, Lane W. Martin, Geoffroy Hautier
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To discover, synthesize, and characterize a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics ($\text{AFEs}$), focusing on $\text{La}_3\text{NbO}_7$, identified through first-principles computational screening.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial $\text{La}_3\text{NbO}_7$ thin films were synthesized, displaying the signature double hysteresis loops of an $\text{AFE}$ material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided clear evidence of the antipolar ground state structure, confirming the prediction. The material exhibits a simple Kittel-type $\text{AFE}$ mechanism and combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx 6 \text{ MV}/\text{cm}$), demonstrating potential for energy-storage applications.

- **Authors**: Jianyu Wu, Arthur Niedermayr, Gaolong Cao, Oscar Grånäs, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To demonstrate femtosecond laser-driven patterning for microscopic and dynamic control of topological quantum states in the Weyl semimetal $\text{WTe}_2$.
- **Finding**: By engineering the excitation field into a transient optical grating, researchers spatially selectively and reversibly drove phase transitions between the topological $T_d$ and trivial $1T^*$ phases of $\text{WTe}_2$. Ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM) directly visualized the formation of a periodic $T_d/1T^*$ heterostructure, observed the propagation of the phase front, and analyzed the nanoscale confinement of coherently excited optical phonon modes, establishing a platform for all-optical, reconfigurable control of quantum states.

**40. [Structural heterogeneity-induced enhancement of transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion revealed by thermoelectric imaging in functionally graded materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03581v1)**
- **Authors**: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To investigate how graded structural heterogeneity in functionally graded materials ($\text{FGMs}$) influences transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion using high-resolution thermoelectric imaging.
- **Finding**: Lock-in thermography ($\text{LIT}$) revealed a non-monotonic enhancement of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect, peaking in the atomic-heterogeneity regime well before full crystallization. Structural analyses using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) confirmed the heterogeneity, revealing $\text{Fe}$-based crystalline alloys and $\text{Cu}$ nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix. This heterogeneity accounts for the enhanced transverse response, which was undetectable by conventional structural or longitudinal transport measurements.

- **Authors**: Asato Onishi, Zifan Xu, Cédric Bareille, Yoichi Kageyama, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Taniuchi, Takasada Shibauchi
- **Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Objective**: To visualize the energy dependence of $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbital anisotropy (orbital nematicity) in real space within individual nematic domains of the $\text{Fe}$-based superconductor $\text{Ba}_{1-x}\text{Na}_x\text{Fe}_2\text{As}_2$.
- **Finding**: Using $5.82$-eV laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) with energy selection, the evolution of linear dichroic ($\text{LD}$) contrast was successfully mapped. The key discovery was a sign reversal of the $\text{LD}$ contrast at an energy $\sim 0.4$ eV below the Fermi level, which directly reveals an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain, highlighting the critical role of orbital-selective coherence in the nematic phase.

**42. [Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01846v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop a full quantum theory describing the interaction between free electrons and light, specifically incorporating the two-photon process, and to relate this theory to the PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac effects.
- **Finding**: The full quantum theory reveals that the two-photon emission/absorption process can be significantly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of the optical near field. Quantum interference between single-photon (PINEM) and two-photon processes was shown to affect electron energy states and entanglement. The theory analytically deduces that the Kapitza-Dirac effect and nonlinear Compton scattering are specific manifestations of the two-photon process, paving the way for future nonlinear quantum interaction studies within electron microscopy platforms.

- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To synthesize sol-gel-derived $\text{NiO}/\text{ZnO}$ thin films in single-layer and heterostructure configurations and investigate the effect of stacking order and $\text{Na}$ doping on supercapacitor performance.
- **Finding**: The $\text{NiO}/\text{ZnO}$ heterostructure exhibited a synergistic effect, achieving a maximum specific capacitance of $1.627 \text{ Fg}^{-1}$, surpassing the single-layer $\text{NiO}$ film. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the surface morphology and structural parameters. Furthermore, $\text{Na}$ doping significantly improved the capacitance of $\text{ZnO}$, demonstrating the potential of these cost-effective, scalable oxide heterostructures for energy storage.

- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To generate unconventional spin-orbit torques ($\text{SOTs}$) and achieve field-free magnetization switching by patterning phase gradients in tungsten ($\text{W}$) thin films using direct-write laser annealing.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), alongside resistivity measurements, tracked the continuous transformation of the $\text{W}$ crystalline phase from the high-$\text{SOT}$ $\beta$-phase to the low-$\text{SOT}$ $\alpha$-phase with increasing laser fluence. By creating sufficiently strong phase gradients, $\text{W}$ wires interfaced with $\text{CoFeB}$ achieved current-induced magnetization switching without an external magnetic field, demonstrating a new method for controlling local $\text{SOT}$ efficiency via microstructure.

**45. [Calorimetric Measurement of the Surface Energy of Enstatite, $\text{MgSiO}_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01314v1)**
- **Authors**: Megan A. Householder, Tamilarasan Subramani, Kristina Lilova, James R. Lyons, Rhonda M. Stroud, Alexandra Navrotsky
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To perform the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite ($\text{MgSiO}_3$) using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry.
- **Finding**: Enstatite nanoparticles synthesized via the sol-gel method consisted of crystallites ($\sim 10-20$ nm) agglomerated into larger particles. Electron microscopy confirmed the morphology and size distribution, which was necessary for calculating surface and interface areas. Analysis yielded a large surface enthalpy of $4.79 \pm 0.45 \text{ J m}^{-2}$, comparable to forsterite, suggesting this high energy may present a barrier to enstatite nucleation in planetary environments.

- **Authors**: Keyu Cao, Sashank Shivakumar, Jian Luo
- **Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Objective**: To fabricate dense ultrafine-grained ($\text{UFG}$) refractory $\text{MoW}$-based alloys and investigate the effect of $2 \text{ at.}\%$ $\text{Co}$ doping on sintering behavior and high-temperature grain growth resistance.
- **Finding**: Dense $\text{UFG}$ alloys (70-180 nm grain size) were produced via high-energy ball milling and spark plasma sintering. $\text{Co}$ doping increased relative densities and significantly suppressed the relative grain growth rate, especially in compositionally complex alloys, consistent with the High-Entropy Grain Boundary ($\text{HEGB}$) effect. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed strong $\text{Co}$ segregation at grain boundaries, supporting the proposed segregation model for enhanced grain growth resistance.

- **Date**: 2025-12-31
- **Objective**: To determine how the confined geometry of palladium nanocrystals influences the phase transformation pathways during hydrogenation to form palladium hydride ($\text{PdH}_x$).
- **Finding**: *In situ* liquid phase transmission electron microscopy ($\text{LP-TEM}$) provided direct visualization of the hydrogenation process in $\text{Pd}$ nanocubes and hexagonal nanoplates. While both followed similar nucleation sequences, the evolving $\alpha/\beta-\text{PdH}_x$ interfaces showed geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments: nanocubes favored $\{100\}$-aligned interfaces (local mechanical equilibrium), whereas nanoplates displayed $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. This demonstrated that nanocrystal geometry is a fundamental parameter directing phase transformation pathways, especially when driven far from equilibrium.

- **Date**: 2025-12-30
- **Objective**: To use modern machine-learned interatomic potentials (ACE and tabGAP) to model and predict radiation damage in $\text{YBa}_2\text{Cu}_3\text{O}_{7-\delta}$ ($\text{YBCO}$) across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries.
- **Finding**: The machine-learned potentials provided a high-fidelity description of atomic-scale collision processes, accurately reproducing DFT data. Molecular dynamics simulations of fusion-relevant $300$ keV cascades revealed the formation of amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length. This finding is consistent with previous electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated high-temperature superconducting ($\text{HTS}$) tapes, establishing these potentials as predictive tools for radiation damage studies.

- **Finding**: Multimodal microscopy, enhanced by a deep-learning framework, successfully translated 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) contrast into quantitative 3D morphologies with accurate facet identification. This analysis, coupled with machine-learning-assisted DFT, demonstrated that reconstruction is controlled by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local minima in the surface energy landscape, thus resolving the complexity of graphene-copper faceting.

- **Finding**: An optimum level of fluoride doping was identified that maximized both *in vitro* biomineralization and biocompatibility with osteoblast-like $\text{MG}-63$ human cells. Electron microscopy was utilized to investigate the *in vitro* biomineralization and biodegradation processes, confirming the formation of hydroxyapatite layers and structural changes following exposure to simulated body fluids.
