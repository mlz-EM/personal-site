- **Objective**: To investigate how the heterogeneity of graphene on $SiC$ affects the epitaxial growth and ordering of the organic semiconductor HMTP.
- **Finding**: It was found that while HMTP forms ordered layers on monolayer graphene, growth on the buffer layer is initially amorphous; however, hydrogen intercalation can restore epitaxy by decoupling the buffer layer. Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and diffraction (LEED) were used to track the molecular ordering from the first layer to thin films.
