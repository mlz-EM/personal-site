**2. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$.
- **Finding**: The study used single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. SC-XRD and STEM revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices consistent with the $Immm$ structure and no uranium vacancies. However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the Te$_{2}$ layers (hosting Te chains along the b axis) using STEM. These defects are argued to cause slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters in SC-XRD and disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$, highlighting the need for minimal structural disorder in future studies.

- **Finding**: The study produced terbium and thulium thin films under controlled conditions, varying water and CO$_{2}$ concentrations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the morphology of the thin films, revealing that water concentrations exceeding 1 vol.-% negatively affect film quality, and the presence of CO$_{2}$ increases carbonate content, also influencing film quality. Raman, IR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the formation of hydroxides, oxides, and carbonates, while neutron activation analysis determined deposition yields.

**8. [Melting point depression of charge density wave in 1T-TiSe$_2$ due to size effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16730v1)**
- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To investigate size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes.
- **Finding**: The study used in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy down to 20 K to observe size-dependent nucleation and melting of CDWs in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes. Specifically, a melting point depression of CDW was observed for flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, a zero-temperature correlation length of 10-50 nm was estimated, matching reported CDW domain sizes. For very small flakes approaching this correlation length, the absence of CDWs was also observed, confirming that an electronic phase transition can follow classical nucleation theory.

**9. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To develop corrections for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements to accurately estimate true surface pore size and porosity in nanoporous membranes, accounting for imaging artifacts.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings in SEM lead to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size in nanoporous membranes. SEM imaging at 1, 5, and 10 kV showed reduced measured porosity with increasing voltage, and increasing Pt coating thickness significantly lowered porosity. A digital correction method was developed to simulate pore dilation, enabling estimation of uncoated membrane pore structure. This dilation yielded significantly higher porosities and mean pore diameters (e.g., 3-fold greater porosity for UF membrane), with dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreeing with low-flux dextran-retention data.

- **Finding**: The researchers directly observed polarization switching pathways by visualizing oxygen site dynamics in ZrO$_{2}$ and Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ freestanding membranes using optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), an advanced atomic-column imaging technique. They found that 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, the study also revealed how different cation species impact accessible polarization switching pathways, providing atomic-level insights for engineering fluorite ferroelectric materials and memory devices.

- **Finding**: The study reported superconducting critical temperatures ($T_c$) up to 3.4 K for IrGe (2.6 K for IrSiGe) films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were crucial in revealing that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface, providing insights into the structural characteristics influencing superconductivity. These findings contribute to the development of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices based on group IV materials.

- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To identify the underlying mechanism for the substantial coercivity in Ce(Co$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$)$_{5}$ permanent magnets.
- **Finding**: Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), the researchers identified a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition in Ce(Co$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)$_{5.4}$ magnets. They observed Cu-poor cylindrical cells (~5-10 nm diameter, ~20 nm long) with a disordered CeCo$_{5}$-type structure and Cu-rich cell boundaries (~5 nm thick) with a modified CeCo$_{5}$ structure. Micromagnetic simulations, informed by these microstructural observations, demonstrated that intrinsic Cu concentration gradients lead to spatial variations in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity.

- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To understand the underlying degradation mechanisms and morphological/chemical changes in Cd-free colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) during operation.
- **Finding**: The study observed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer, QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer of Cd-free QD-LEDs during operation. This was accompanied by the generation and diffusion of oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. Acrylate-based resin-encapsulation stabilized the layers by suppressing radical formation and morphology changes, leading to significant lifetime improvements and providing insights into degradation pathways.

- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron ptychography phase imaging using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The study applied the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance. It found that for a weak-phase object, ptychography cannot reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but is more robust to partial coherence. This work provides a quantitative framework for comparing the performance of HRTEM and ptychography, especially for dose-sensitive materials, by considering both signal and noise transfer.

- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To uncover the reconstruction behavior of the CeO$_{2}$(100) surface and its impact on reactivity.
- **Finding**: The study discovered a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO$_{2}$(100) surface through an integrated approach including in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), global structure search, machine learning potentials, and DFT calculations. STEM confirmed the reconstructed surface's thermodynamic and kinetic stability, characterized by alternating Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. This orbital hybridization-driven reconstruction, particularly the localized Ce$^{3+}$ polarons, activates O 2p states, enhancing electron-donating capacity and facilitating H$_{2}$O dissociation, revealing a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism governing surface reactivity.

- **Finding**: The MatQnA dataset includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), among others. It uses a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to construct high-quality question-answer pairs. Preliminary evaluations showed that advanced multi-modal AI models achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions related to materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for AI applications in this specialized field.

- **Authors**: Yuqing Xing, Hui Chen, Li Huang, Roger Guzman, Qi Zheng, Senhao Lv, Jinan Shi, Haitao Yang, Wu Zhou, Hong-Jun Gao
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To uncover and understand the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping the quantum states of the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$S$_{2}$.
- **Finding**: The study uncovered intrinsic quantum clusters on the surface of Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$S$_{2}$ using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM/EELS). These clusters were identified as native oxygen defects. STEM/EELS confirmed their presence and chemical nature. On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities occupy hollow sites and tune the flat band near the Fermi level, exhibiting an unconventional Zeeman effect. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials generate occupied impurity states with varying symmetries but no measurable magnetic response, establishing these clusters as tunable local perturbations.

**20. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study systematically compared non-raster trajectories (spiral and multi-pass sequential patterns) against traditional raster scans for EELS and ptychography. Ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position. In contrast, atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Spiral scanning under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO$_{3}$ thin films improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions, establishing practical guidelines for programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM and highlighting ptychography's inherent resilience to trajectory-induced artifacts.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate the fabrication of all-in-plane superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak link junctions in FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ thin films using focused Si$^{++}$ ion beams.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated "nanosculpting" ~100 nm-wide channels into FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ thin films using a Si$^{++}$ focused ion beam (FIB), creating controllable weak links where increasing ion dose progressively suppressed critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$). Kelvin probe force microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) corroborated the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region. $I_c$(B) measurements revealed that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion. Tuning beam energy and dose allowed shifting from an SC-N-SC to an SC-I-SC geometry, establishing FIB patterning as a versatile platform for fabricating robust, scalable Josephson junctions.

- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) in In$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and understand its underlying mechanism.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in In$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ FeS-FETs. Combining high-resolution electron microscopy with electrical transport measurements, the NDR was attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance alpha-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging (high-resolution electron microscopy) revealed that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments generating Moire patterns, and intralayer shear, all contributing to stress-induced phase transitions.

- **Finding**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations revealed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes as nanoparticle edges are approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained these observations by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, emphasizing the need for full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. The study also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials for accurate DFT extrapolations.

- **Objective**: To compare machine learning (variational autoencoders, VAEs) and physics-based methods for determining the geometries (orientation and aspect ratio) of gold nanorods (NRs) using far-field spectral properties.
- **Finding**: The study used a dual-branch multimodal VAE, trained on paired polarized dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images, to predict gold nanorod geometries from spectra-only input. Electron microscopy images provided the ground truth for training and validating the VAE's predictions. The VAE achieved good performance for orientational angle prediction (MAE of 14.4, CCC of 0.95) with a small training set, comparable to physics-based fitting (MAE of 8.78, CCC of 0.99). Aspect ratio determination also showed similar performance between VAE and physics-based methods, demonstrating that machine learning can accurately infer nanostructure morphology from optical spectra, leveraging electron microscopy for ground truth.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate the tunable synthesis of previously unreported crystal phases of CrS$_{2}$ (1T$'$ and 1T) and Cr$_{2}$S$_{3}$ via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD).
- **Finding**: The study achieved tunable synthesis of 1T$'$ CrS$_{2}$ and 1T CrS$_{2}$ via MOCVD, identifying these phases using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction. 4D-STEM characterization was crucial in revealing that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation from 1T to 1T$'$, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals. The 1T$'$ CrS$_{2}$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature, shedding light on the magnetic properties of this predicted material and paving the way for scalable synthesis of 2D magnets.
