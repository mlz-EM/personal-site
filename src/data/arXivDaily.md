**1. [On the Feasibility of Extreme Heating Rates in SEM using MEMS Heater Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05831v1)**
- **Authors**: C. Koenig, P. Mayr, J. R. Jinschek, A. Bastos Fanta
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the feasibility of using micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) heating platforms for *in-situ* scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of bulk-like samples during rapid thermal cycling.
- **Finding**: Stable heating and cooling rates up to $1000 \,^{\circ}\text{C/s}$ were achieved under vacuum conditions with minimal power input.

- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of precipitate size in a $\text{Mg-1.35wt.\%Mn}$ alloy during room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT).

- **Finding**: The full quantum theory reveals that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be significantly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of the optical near field. This theoretical framework paves the way for future experimental studies using advanced electron microscopy techniques, such as Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM), to explore nonlinear quantum processes in electron-photon interactions.

This methodology resolved the complexity of graphene-copper faceting, demonstrating that reconstruction is governed by a unified thermodynamic mechanism where high-index facets correspond to specific local minima in the surface energy landscape.

**39. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To study the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios in electrodeposited overlays on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings.

- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural characteristics and spectroscopic properties of a natural Ib-IaA diamond crystal containing Y-defects.
- **Finding**: **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** of the zone with abundant Y-defects revealed various dislocation configurations and numerous clusters of point defects. Extended defects, identified as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) shaped like thin rhombic plates (1–3 nm thick), were observed. It is suggested that recombination processes at the internal walls of these discovered nanovoids are responsible for the unusual, blinking photoluminescence lines observed under $787$ nm laser excitation.
