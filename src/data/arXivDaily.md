**1. [Template masks for 4D-STEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06371v1)**
- **Authors**: Yining Xie, Eoin Moynihan, Marin Alexe, Louis Piper, Ana Sanchez, Richard Beanland
- **Date**: 2025-08-08
- **Objective**: Present a new analysis method called "template masks" for atomic resolution four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to optimize imaging for specific atom columns.
- **Finding**: The paper introduces template masks as a computationally straightforward and general method for 4D-STEM data analysis. This technique applies an image (template) to the data to obtain a mask, which shows the correlation between the data and the template, producing an image optimized for the template. This method significantly improves over user-defined masks, enabling separate imaging of Li and O atom columns in LiFePO$_4$ and O, Pb, and Ti across a domain wall in PbTiO$_3$, and is particularly effective for specimens where multiple scattering produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.

- **Authors**: Shreshth A. Malik, Tiarnan A. S. Doherty, Benjamin Colmey, Stephen J. Roberts, Yarin Gal, Paul A. Midgley
- **Date**: 2025-08-08
- **Objective**: Present a novel hybrid physics-machine learning framework that integrates differentiable physical simulations with neural networks for quantitative crystal structure refinements in electron microscopy, addressing the challenge of modeling real-world experimental effects.
- **Finding**: The framework leverages automatic differentiation throughout the simulation pipeline, enabling gradient-based joint optimization of physical parameters and neural network components representing experimental variables. Applied to three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D-ED) structure refinement, this approach learns complex thickness distributions directly from diffraction data, achieving state-of-the-art refinement performance across synthetic and experimental datasets by recovering atomic positions, thermal displacements, and thickness profiles with high fidelity. This establishes differentiable hybrid modeling as a powerful new paradigm for quantitative electron microscopy.

- **Date**: 2025-08-06
- **Objective**: Develop a straightforward and accessible method for determining the crystallographic orientation of black phosphorus (BP) from bulk crystals to thin layers using angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) with a single-wavelength (514 nm) Raman setup.
- **Finding**: By incorporating thickness-dependent interference effects and anisotropic optical indices, this ARPRS approach provides a reliable framework for orientation determination across different BP thicknesses. The method is validated through direct orientation measurements using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD), confirming its applicability to both thick and ultrathin samples. Given its simplicity and compatibility with widely available Raman setups, this offers a practical solution for characterizing BP orientation without requiring advanced structural characterization techniques.

- **Authors**: Shuo Chen, Yijin Li, Xi Zheng, Guofeng Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05

- **Finding**: NFH-SEM fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural field representation, eliminating manual calibration procedures through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangling shadows from SEM images during training. The method demonstrates high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse, challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, showcasing precise detail and broad applicability for SEM 3D reconstruction.

**6. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the structural and electronic properties of as-grown and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ polycrystals to elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.
- **Finding**: Using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the study found that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers into p-d hybridized orbitals, ultimately suppressing superconductivity, a behavior distinct from cuprate superconductors. These findings reveal a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

- **Authors**: Mingyu Liu, Zian Mao, Zhu Liu, Haoran Zhang, Jintao Guo, Xiaoya He, Xi Huang, Shufen Chu, Chun Cheng, Jun Ding, Yujun Xie
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: Develop an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline, 4D-PreNet, for preprocessing 4D-STEM data to address pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions that constrain high-throughput data acquisition and quantitative measurements.
- **Finding**: 4D-PreNet integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. Trained on large simulated datasets, the network generalizes effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that this pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization (average errors below 0.04 pixels), significantly improving noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis.

**8. [Experimental evidence of disordered crystalline premixing in sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01484v1)**
- **Authors**: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: Directly measure and characterize the premixed phase at the interfaces of sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which are known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements directly reveal a disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which differs from previously reported a priori predictions of an amorphous interlayer. This disordered FCC phase retains its symmetry after annealing, with a lattice parameter shift consistent with an Al-rich composition. The existence of this crystalline premix is attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.

- **Date**: 2025-07-31
- **Objective**: Explore the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings, specifically to simultaneously measure conical diffraction and diffuse scattering to evaluate the sensitivity of scattering patterns to grating structure.
- **Finding**: Synchrotron measurements, combined with numerical simulations and data from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), demonstrate that the diffraction component of the pattern is sensitive to the average groove profile of the gratings, while the diffuse scattering depends on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface. These findings highlight the potential of synchrotron measurements as a powerful nanometrology tool for modern optical elements.

Heitmann, Matthias Frontzek, William D. Ratcliff, Gregory T. McCandless, Julia Y. Chan, Elton J. G. Santos, Jeehoon Kim, Charudatta M. Phatak, Vadym Kulichenko, Luis Balicas
- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: Investigate the structural and magnetic properties of the layered compound Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ to understand its high Curie temperature, low dimensionality, and the presence of topological spin textures, particularly focusing on local inversion symmetry breaking and its magnetic ground state.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques revealed that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking while maintaining global inversion symmetry, providing a convincing explanation for the presence of N\'{e}el skyrmions observed via Lorentz-TEM in this centrosymmetric material. Magnetization and neutron diffraction studies indicate a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase transition to a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, which is correlated with the hysteresis observed in both skyrmion density and magnetization, suggesting that topological spin textures are affected by the development of ferrimagnetism.

**11. [Revealing Nanoscale Ni-Oxidation State Variations in Single-Crystal NMC811 via 2D and 3D Spectro-Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22834v1)**
- **Authors**: Ralf F. Ziesche, Michael J. Johnson, Ingo Manke, Joshua H. Cruddos, Alice V. Llewellyn, Chun Tan, Rhodri Jervis, Paul R. Shearing, Christoph Rau, Alexander J. E. Rettie, Silvia Cipiccia, Darren Batey
- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: Develop a high-throughput data collection strategy for 2D and 3D ptychography combined with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to visualize local Ni oxidation state behavior in single-crystal NMC811 cathodes with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, and correlate this with chemical degradation during high-voltage cycling.
- **Finding**: The high-throughput spectro-ptychography methodology enables rapid visualization of Ni oxidation state variations, serving as a proxy for state-of-charge. By employing this technique at various stages during lifetime cycling, direct mapping of chemical degradation along the Li channels, identification of nucleation sites, and observation of Ni oxidation state heterogeneities across both electrode and particle scales can be achieved. These heterogeneities are further correlated with the formation and growth of the rocksalt phase and oxygen-induced planar gliding, advancing the fundamental understanding of degradation in high-Ni layered oxide materials.

- **Objective**: Report the realization of Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) nanowaveguides and experimentally observe second harmonic generation (SHG) in these structures, demonstrating their potential for integrated nonlinear photonics.
- **Finding**: ZnS thin films were deposited via RF magnetron sputtering and characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ellipsometry. The study details the fabrication and optical characterization of ZnS nanowaveguides, leading to the experimental observation of SHG in such structures. These findings establish ZnS as a promising platform for nonlinear photonic applications, particularly in compact and integrated frequency conversion devices.

- **Objective**: Synthesize and characterize cobalt ferrite (CoFe$_2$O$_4$) nanoparticles and investigate their photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of organic dyes using a low-power white LED as a light source.
- **Finding**: CoFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles were synthesized via the sol-gel method and characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman, and Infrared spectroscopy for structural analysis, and UV-visible spectroscopy for band gap evaluation. The material demonstrated high photocatalytic activity, decomposing 95% of methyl orange and methylene blue aqueous solutions after 150 minutes of irradiation, with further improvement to over 90% decomposition within 90 minutes upon hydrogen peroxide addition.

**14. [Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: Revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism from scattering theory to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data and consequently identify new imaging modes.
- **Finding**: The study shows that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk (corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC)) enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximally uses 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond WPOA, contrast transfer from inelastic/plural scattering electrons is identified, showing enhanced contrast under overfocus conditions. A tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) is also constructed, demonstrating usable information in the dark field region for depth sectioning of strong scatterers, providing analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography.

**15. [Defect migration in supercrystalline nanocomposites](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20826v1)**
- **Authors**: Dmitry Lapkin, Cong Yan, Emre Gürsoy, Hadas Sternlicht, Alexander Plunkett, Büsra Bor, Young Yong Kim, Dameli Assalauova, Fabian Westermeier, Michael Sprung, Tobias Krekeler, Surya Snata Rout, Martin Ritter, Satishkumar Kulkarni, Thomas F. Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: Investigate the distinct roles of processing steps (pressing and heat treatment) in the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs).
- **Finding**: X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses reveal that pressing SCNCs into bulk pellets distorts the otherwise FCC superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Crucially, heat treatment, at temperatures applied for organic crosslinking, significantly affects planar defects: stacking faults migrate and heal (confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations), and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries undergo structural changes. These rearrangements of defects at the supercrystalline scale provide new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles.

**16. [Femtosecond Engineering of magnetic Domain Walls via Nonequilibrium Spin Textures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20701v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: Directly image the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms for ultrafast magnetic control.
- **Finding**: Using Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation, the study observed a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs formed and spontaneously vanished within picoseconds. Multiscale simulations revealed a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs, explaining the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering and establishing a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials on femtosecond timescales.

**17. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: Propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware statistical framework for assessing the recoverable signal in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, addressing the limitations of the widely used contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: Numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.

- **Authors**: Elizaveta Gangrskaia, Thomas Schachinger, Christoph Eisenmenger-Sittner, Lorenz Grünewald, Sebastian Mai, Andrius Baltuška, Audrius Pugžlys, Alessandra Bellissimo
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: Present an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation, and test this technique on Eu$^{3+}$ ions to probe inherently weak magnetic dipole transitions.
- **Finding**: The study generated spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses specifically optimized for the spectral and spatial selective excitation of magnetic dipole and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. In the presence of the metallic antenna, excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam provided at least a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition compared to other beams, thus offering new opportunities for the spectroscopy of forbidden transitions.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: Investigate the arrangement of dipoles within polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, which are silicon-compatible ferroelectrics known for self-organizing into alternating 2D polar and nonpolar layers, to explore potential non-uniformity.
- **Finding**: Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in the plan view orientation, the study revealed strikingly non-uniform dipole organization within these irreducibly narrow polar layers of ZrO$_2$, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls. These head-to-head and tail-to-tail walls each adopt completely distinctive interfacial structures and confine the in-plane domains to a sub-nm$^2$ footprint, making them one of the smallest domains reported. This work represents the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale.

- **Authors**: Pengcheng Li, Chenglin Pua, Zehao Dong, Zhengxiong Su, Tao Liu, Chao Cai, Huahai Shen, Lin Gu, Zhen Chen
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: Demonstrate that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) can overcome limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy to precisely determine the atomic-scale distribution of hydrogen in materials, which is challenging due to hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility.
- **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is shown to provide exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP successfully resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work demonstrates MEP as a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.

- **Finding**: The study formulates parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, enabling upsampling in direct ptychography and relaxing its traditional stringent Nyquist sampling requirements for resolution. This allows for the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave with less dense probe step sizes, and the analytical results are demonstrated numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.

**22. [Programmable phase selection between altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe on InP via molecular beam epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18592v1)**
- **Authors**: An-Hsi Chen, Parul R. Raghuvanshi, Jacob Cook, Michael Chilcote, Jason Lapano, Alessandro R. Mazza, Qiangsheng Lu, Sangsoo Kim, Yueh-Chun Wu, T. Zac Ward, Benjamin Lawrie, Guang Bian, James Burns, Jonathan D. Poplawsky, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Lucas Lindsay, Hu Miao, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Valentino R. Cooper, Matthew Brahlek
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: Establish how subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates can program the phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth, aiming for high structural quality and phase purity.
- **Finding**: Electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction studies indicate that phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface. The bulk altermagnetic hexagonal NiAs-structure MnTe is stabilized on the (111)A surface (In-terminated) of InP, while the non-centrosymmetric, cubic ZnS-structure is stabilized on the (111)B surface (P-terminated). First principles calculations suggest that interfacial termination and strain significantly affect the interfacial energy, confirming the observed phase selectivity and enabling the growth of high-quality MnTe polymorphs for spintronics and microelectronic devices.

**23. [Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364v1)**
- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: Investigate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during repeated ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions in FeRh thin films, specifically how cumulative laser irradiation alters the nucleation pathway.
- **Finding**: Using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high structural and magnetic resolution, the study observed that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, causing the transition to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices, which are pinned in the film by underlying dislocation networks formed and rearranged upon repeated phase transition crossings. This establishes a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: Enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of a chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films using accelerator-based fast ion implantation.
- **Finding**: Electrical transport and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the NLMR and crystallinity of Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films. Both surface-doped and bulk-doped Nb-Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films displayed a significant enhancement (over 100% relative) of the maximum NLMR compared to pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films, while maintaining crystallinity. This demonstrates high-energy ion implantation as a practical route to realize chiralitronic functionalities in topological semimetals.

**25. [Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940v2)**
- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: Examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) optically trapped in vacuum.
- **Finding**: Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) functionalized with ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate were optically trapped in vacuum. Differences in oscillation frequency, width, and amplitude of peaks with respect to the motion of the SiNPs were detected and explained by a theoretical model. Linear discriminant analysis and random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out, it did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types, highlighting the high sensitivity of the optomechanical method.

- **Objective**: Develop an inverse modeling framework to explicitly relate the angular shifts in Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to the strain and lattice rotation tensors, and perform sensitivity analysis.
- **Finding**: The paper develops an inverse modeling formalism for DFXM, demonstrating that the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) can be reconstructed using oblique diffraction geometry. It also provides a computational framework for both forward calculation and reconstruction of this tensor, along with a sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific DFXM angles and compute associated errors, which will assist in interpreting and designing DFXM experiments for spatially resolved strain measurements.

- **Finding**: The authors developed MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model, which, when integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), significantly enhances the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes. This hybrid approach greatly improves the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns obtained via multislice electron ptychography, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.
