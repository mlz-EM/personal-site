- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate an all-in-plane method for fabricating superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak link Josephson junctions by "nanosculpting" channels into thin films of FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ using a focused Si$^{++}$ ion beam (FIB).
- **Finding**: The study successfully "nanosculpted" ~100 nm-wide channels into thin films of FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ using a Si$^{++}$ focused ion beam (FIB), creating controllable weak links. Systematic irradiation showed that increasing the ion dose suppressed both critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$). *Kelvin probe force microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)* corroborated the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region, providing direct visualization of the fabricated nanostructures. $I_c(B)$ measurements revealed that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion.

- **Authors**: Mengqi Sun, Zixu Huang, Muammer Y. Yaman, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin, David S. Ginger
- **Date**: 2025-09-09
- **Objective**: To explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for determining the geometries (orientation and aspect ratio) of gold nanorods (NRs) from far-field polarized dark-field scattering spectra, and compare its performance with physics-based analysis.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that a dual-branch multimodal VAE, trained on paired scattering spectra and *electron microscopy images*, could effectively predict the orientational angle and aspect ratio of gold nanorods using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra. The inclusion of *electron microscopy images* in the training dataset was crucial for the VAE to learn a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology. The VAE achieved performance comparable to physics-based methods for both orientational angle (MAE of 14.4 vs 8.78) and aspect ratio (MAE of 0.21 vs 0.23), even with a small training set, suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems.

- **Finding**: The study employed *operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) electric field biasing* to directly resolve the multi-step antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in PbZrO$_3$ thin films. *Atomic-resolution imaging* revealed several metastable phases during the transition. Complementary *nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic scale analysis* showed that the pathway and end states could be modulated, leading to a "dead layer" near the substrate with suppressed switching. Dynamic phase transformations were observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases at a transition front, driven by competing internal and external fields, providing critical experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions.

- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and underlying mechanisms in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture in the elastic regime of the DP steel. *Fractographic studies* indicated intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology at crack initiation, while *site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations* revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture, with *site-specific TEM and transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies* revealing $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking. *Electron backscatter diffraction studies* on cross-sectional cracks further supported the hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity.

Nanoindentation experiments with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip extracted position-dependent spring constant and pretension. The all-polymer metasurface achieved high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, enabling straightforward geometry-based tuning of linewidth and resonance position.
