- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for accurately determining the twist angles in artificially stacked $\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{Ca}\text{Cu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$ (BSCCO) cuprate heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Clear optical fingerprints of rotational misalignment were identified by analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, specifically utilizing the out-of-plane $A_{1g}$ vibrational mode of $\text{Bi}/\text{Sr}$ at $116~\text{cm}^{-1}$.

- **Finding**: Tetragonal films ($x=0.8$ and $1$) exhibit unusual two-component behavior in their Hall and Nernst hysteresis loops. This is attributed to the coexistence of two crystallographic orientations (a-axis and c-axis normal to the film) and the opposite sign of AHE/ANE for magnetization along the a and c axes, as predicted by DFT. *EM Contribution*: Electron microscopy was used to characterize the crystal structure, confirming the tetragonal distortion and the co-existence of two different crystallographic orientations in the thin films, which is essential for explaining the anisotropic transport effects.

- **Authors**: Yaozhu Li, Szilvia Kalácska, Phil McCausland, Roberta L. Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To analyze the multiscale microstructure of olivine in the Martian shergottite NWA 7721 to determine its deformation history prior to impact.
- **Finding**: The olivine exhibits a bimodal microstructure: fine, strain-free Type 1 subgrains (shock-induced recrystallization) and coarse, highly strained Type 2 subgrains (preserving parent grain deformation). Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) revealed slip-band features in Type 2, while Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) helped characterize the orientation and strain. This bimodal structure suggests the olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress on Mars before the impact event.

- **Objective**: To review the implementation and potential of temporal coincidence experiments coupling different electron spectroscopies (involving photons and inelastic electrons) within a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) for high-resolution analysis.
- **Finding**: Temporal coincidence experiments, coupling techniques like Cathodoluminescence (CL), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), and light injection in the nanosecond to femtosecond range, can provide information bits regarding chemical, electronic, and optical properties that are inaccessible to independent spectroscopies. This approach, implemented in STEM, pushes the spatial resolution of these coupled measurements down to the atomic scale.

- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the stacking faults, which have a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_{o}$. The investigation showed that these faults annihilate in sets of four, resulting in four possible directions of the $\text{S}_{3}$ order parameter related to $\text{NbO}_{6}$ octahedral tilts. TEM analysis, combined with force-field calculations, revealed that the stacking faults significantly affect the local polar modes, which could influence the material's ferroelectric properties.
