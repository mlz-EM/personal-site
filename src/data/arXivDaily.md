- **Authors**: Shengbo You, Georgios Varnavides, Sagar Khavnekar, Nikita Palatkin, Sihan Shao, Mingjian Wu, Daniel Stroppa, Darya Chernikova, Baixu Zhu, Ricardo Egoavil, Stefano Vespucci, Xingchen Ye, Florian K. M. Schur, Erdmann Spiecker, Philipp Pelz
- **Date**: 2025-12-22
- **Objective**: To introduce Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM), a 4D-STEM modality that achieves gap-free phase contrast by optimally combining bright-field ptychography and dark-field imaging data.
- **Finding**: FF-STEM successfully overcomes the characteristic contrast gap at low spatial frequencies in linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) by fusing data from two complementary scattering channels. The bright-field data are used for high-resolution phase reconstruction via ptychography, while the dark-field data provide the missing low-frequency contrast, resulting in dose-efficient, transfer-gap-free images with high quantitative fidelity, representing a significant methodological advance in 4D-STEM.

- **Authors**: P. Shvets, G. Kirichuk, V. Salnikov, J. O'Connell, V. Rodionova, A. Goikhman, K. Maksimova
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To reveal the distinct crystallization pathway of amorphous $\mathrm{Co_{40}Fe_{40}B_{20}}$ thin films during vacuum annealing.
- **Finding**: Comprehensive structural characterization, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compositional analysis, demonstrated that vacuum annealing drives the formation of a metastable $\tau$-boride phase, $(\mathrm{Co,Fe})_{23}\mathrm{B_6}$, with high crystalline quality and minimal boron loss, rather than the typical body-centered cubic CoFe. This transition to the boron-rich metastable phase resulted in an improvement of magnetic properties, including increased saturation magnetization and coercivity.

**11. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Ptsingle bondRu overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v1)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios in electrodeposited overlays on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings.
- **Finding**: Coatings with higher Pt content exhibited superior oxidation resistance, attributed to the formation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous $\alpha-\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ layer in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO). Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS) was essential for analyzing the TGO layer, confirming that increasing Ru content led to the development of microcracks and less protective oxides, thereby undermining oxidation protection.

- **Authors**: N. V. Porokhov, M. A. Dryazgov, A. R. Shevchenko, A. M. Mumlyakov, Z. S. Enbaev, Yu. V. Blinova, D. I. Devyaterikov, Yu. P. Korneeva, A. A. Korneev, M. A. Tarkhov
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the use of a scandium nitride (ScN) buffer layer to improve the superconducting properties of thin niobium nitride (NbN) films.
- **Finding**: The ScN buffer layer significantly improved the superconducting characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films, increasing the critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) from 9 K to 12.5 K and reducing resistivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction confirmed that these enhancements are directly attributed to the better lattice matching provided by the ScN layer, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice structure in the overlying NbN film.

**21. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: To report a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in $\mathrm{LiNbO_3}$ and $\mathrm{LiTaO_3}$ and identify its origin in defect-bound unpaired electrons.
- **Finding**: Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L-TEM) provided direct visualization of the magnetic-field-induced formation of room-temperature skyrmion states, which quench the slow polarization relaxation of defect-bound unpaired electrons. This collective spin ordering transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, resulting in an EO efficiency enhancement (up to $34~\mathrm{pm/V}$ in $\mathrm{LiNbO_3}$) that significantly surpasses conventional room-temperature magnetoelectric responses.

**22. [Diamond crystal with Y-defects: spectroscopy and transmittion electron microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12278v1)**
- **Authors**: A. A. Shiryaev, E. F. Vasilev, A. L. Vasilev, V. V. Artemov, N. V. Gubanov, D. A. Zedgenizov
- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural defects and associated photoluminescence properties of a natural Ib-IaA diamond containing Y-defects.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the Y-defect zone revealed the presence of dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects generated by non-conservative dislocation motion. TEM contrast analysis further identified extended defects as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters) resembling thin rhombic plates (1-3 nm thick), suggesting that recombination processes at the internal walls of these nanovoids may explain the observed irregular temporal variations (blinking) in the photoluminescence lines.

- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To directly image nanometric skyrmion lattices and investigate the limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for determining the chirality of ultrasmall topological spin textures.
- **Finding**: Nanometric skyrmion lattices were observed in $\text{B}20$-structured $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ crystals. Conventional Fresnel contrast analysis showed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)**, specifically using Fresnel mode and systematic **off-axis electron holography**, was crucial for direct real-space imaging and for attributing the chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function, thereby establishing quantitative limitations for imaging ultrasmall skyrmions.

**27. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies in $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet and determine if they arise from chiral spin textures (Topological Hall Effect).
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they showed little correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, suggesting a trivial origin likely due to sample inhomogeneity leading to multiple anomalous Hall channels. Most importantly, **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** measurements were performed and definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet, demonstrating that transport anomalies alone are insufficient evidence for skyrmions in bulk systems.

- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework integrating modeling, simulation, and experiment to demonstrate and understand the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and simulations predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, eventually leading to rupture via bobber formation. **In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) experiments** on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed the strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary control mechanism.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of neural network segmentation models with respect to varying imaging conditions in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).
- **Finding**: Neural network segmentation models showed significant performance stability, but their performance smoothly and predictably worsened as imaging conditions shifted from the training distribution. The **HRTEM contrast transfer function (CTF)** was utilized to develop a framework that compares information content and quantifies OOD domain shifts in **HRTEM** datasets, providing a methodology for understanding generalization behavior in experimental EM workflows.

- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03

**42. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
