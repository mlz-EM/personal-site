**1. [Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17801v1)**
- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate and optimize imaging strategies for characterizing the structure of 3D DNA origami nanostructures using transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study found that Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), particularly with a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at a camera length of 600 mm, consistently provided the highest contrast for imaging DNA origami. Thicker 3D nanotubes showed higher contrast than 6-helix bundles, and heavy metal staining (uranyl formate, palladium) effectively enhanced contrast while largely preserving structural integrity and dimensions. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami, even for unstained samples, and offer practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions.

Ultrafast electron microscopy, combined with hardware and algorithmic advances, was crucial in achieving spatial and temporal resolutions each an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, enabling these unprecedented observations of topological defect dynamics.

**13. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v2)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron ptychography for imaging beam-sensitive materials, using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).

- **Finding**: The study discovered a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the $CeO_2$(100) surface, which was found to be thermodynamically and kinetically stable. *In situ* scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), combined with computational methods, was crucial for identifying this reconstruction characterized by alternating $Ce^{3+}$ and $Ce^{4+}$ ions and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. The findings reveal that orbital hybridization, driven by localized $Ce^{3+}$ polarons, activates surface $O$ $2p$ states, enhancing electron-donating capacity and facilitating molecular dissociation, providing a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism for tuning catalytic performance.

**17. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam scanning trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study found that ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position, while atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Importantly, spiral scanning under cryogenic conditions improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions in $BaTiO_3$ thin films, establishing practical guidelines for programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM and highlighting ptychography's resilience to trajectory-induced artifacts.

- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and understand the gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in $In_2Se_3$ ferroelectric semiconducting field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable NDR with high peak-to-valley ratios in $In_2Se_3$ FeS-FETs, attributing it to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. High-resolution electron microscopy, combined with electrical transport measurements, was crucial for atomic-scale *ex-situ* imaging, revealing that in-plane electric fields ($V_d$) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments, and intralayer shear, leading to stress-induced phase transitions, while out-of-plane fields cause robust non-volatile polarization switching.

- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that a dual-branch multimodal VAE, trained on paired spectra-image data, could accurately predict Au NR orientation and aspect ratio using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra. Electron microscopy images were used as ground truth for training and validating the VAE, showing that the VAE's performance for orientational angle and aspect ratio prediction was comparable to physics-based fitting approaches, even with a small training dataset, suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems.

- **Finding**: *Operando* scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) electric field biasing allowed direct observation of a multi-step transition in $PbZrO_3$ thin films, involving several metastable phases. Atomic-resolution imaging and complementary nano-beam electron diffraction revealed that this pathway and its end states could be modulated, leading to a "dead layer" with suppressed switching. Dynamic phase transformations were observed at a transition front between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases, driven by competing internal and external fields, providing critical experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions.

**25. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v2)**
- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and mechanism, specifically hydrogen-induced fast fracture, in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture within the elastic regime, with fractographic studies showing intergranular and quasi-cleavage initiation. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and later, predominant brittle fracture with {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies on cross-sectional cracks supported the explanation of HE via a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity, inhibiting crack blunting.

- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: To understand how dopants self-organize within amorphous interfacial complexions in multi-component nanocrystalline alloys and how this affects local structure.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) and elemental analysis were used to study grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, revealing chemical partitioning and patterning of dopants, particularly at the amorphous-crystalline transition regions. Atomistic simulations, informed by these experimental observations, showed that increased grain boundary chemical complexity results in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. This demonstrates an intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions.

- **Finding**: A bilayer PMMA recipe was developed, enabling the convenient fabrication of freestanding membranes for metasurfaces, achieving high quality nanopatterns by circumventing etching-induced defects. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the suspended membrane, and nanoindentation with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip extracted its position-dependent spring constant and pretension. The resulting all-polymer metasurfaces demonstrated high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, despite the low refractive index of the polymer.

- **Finding**: Room-temperature Brinell indentation was used to generate a plastic zone without crack formation in bi-crystal SrTiO$_3$ with a 4$^{\circ}$ tilt grain boundary. Combined with dislocation etch pits imaging and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, the study observed dislocation pileup, storage, and transmission across the low-angle tilt grain boundary. These experimental observations provide new insight into dislocation-grain boundary interaction at room temperature at the mesoscale.

- **Authors**: Tengfei Liu, Xiyu Hong, Zhe Li, Shenzhong Chen, Leyi Li, Xin-Yi Tang, Shuying Cheng, Yunfeng Lai, Yonghai Chen, Zhu Diao, Ke He, Qi-kun Xue, Jinling Yu
- **Date**: 2025-09-04
- **Objective**: To investigate thickness-induced topological phase transitions in $\alpha$-Sn films grown on CdTe(110) using helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC).
- **Finding**: HDPC measurements revealed a distinct dependence on film thickness, showing an odd-function dependence for 5 nm films and an even-function dependence for 10 and 30 nm films. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), combined with point-group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, revealed that a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a two-dimensional (2D) to a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator occurs between 5 and 10 nm. This demonstrates HDPC as a sensitive diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions.

- **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
- **Date**: 2025-08-31
- **Objective**: To apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te phase-change materials.
- **Finding**: After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction, k-means clustering was applied to 4D-STEM data of Ge-Sb-Te, identifying four distinct clusters. Mapping these clusters back to the diffraction data and analyzing elemental intensity histograms revealed significant local chemical signatures (e.g., oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium in Cluster 4) and structural variations. This demonstrates that clustering analysis of 4D-STEM data provides a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in phase-change materials.

- **Authors**: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To grow epitaxial 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001) by molecular beam epitaxy and characterize their structural and electronic properties.
- **Finding**: 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers were epitaxially grown on GaN(0001), with in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED) confirming optimal structural properties at high growth temperatures.

- **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain in controlling polarization and chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films.
- **Finding**: Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that large anisotropic compressive strain in BFO films on LSMO-buffered NdGaO$_3$ substrates promotes ferroelectric domain formation. A fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer was deterministically formed on regions polarized oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization, compensating for it. This mechanism was leveraged to stabilize uniform out-of-plane polarization by inserting a Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius buffer layer, and signatures of homochiral polarization textures were observed, offering new strategies for controlling polarization and chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics.

Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies showed consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural context was available. This approach establishes a data-driven pathway for non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization by leveraging 4D-STEM data.

- **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced experimental techniques and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with molecular dynamics simulations revealed that previously observed broad transitional regions in AlScN are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, not a transient nonpolar intermediate phase. STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched films further confirmed this. Simulations showed that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly explaining the zigzag-shaped domain walls and consistency with nucleation-limited switching behavior.

**43. [Crystalline-to-Crystalline Phase Transition between Germanium Selenide Polymorphs with High Resistance Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17997v1)**
- **Authors**: Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the crystalline-to-crystalline phase transition between GeSe polymorphs induced by thermal or laser heating, focusing on structural and electronic properties.
- **Finding**: The study observed a phase transition where highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe upon global annealing or localized laser-induced heating, while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis investigated the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface. The clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures, leading to the formation of $\alpha$-GeSe through minor GeSe$_2$ segregation, was proposed as a key mechanism. A high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$ between the polymorphs was observed.

**44. [Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17085v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: To investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations in the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and its underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed a novel cross-slip mechanism where Shockley partial dislocations cross-slip from one $\{111\}$ plane to another conjugate $\{111\}$ plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies. This mechanism, along with local stress concentrations, enhances the high-temperature deformation resistance of the alloy by forming sessile stair-rod dislocations.

- **Finding**: The (CoNi)$_{81}$Mo$_{12}$Al$_{7}$ alloy demonstrated exceptional yield strength (1086 MPa), tensile strength (1520 MPa), and ductility (35%). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) dislocation analysis, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealed that Mo substitution for Al in the L1$_2$ phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting multiple deformation modes including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These mechanisms, facilitated by low stacking fault energy and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries, offer a novel strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs.
