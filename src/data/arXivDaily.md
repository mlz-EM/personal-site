**1. [Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320v1)**
- **Authors**: Tim Titze, Sabri Koraltan, Timo Schmidt, Mailin Matthies, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Dieter Suess, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil
- **Date**: 2025-10-24
- **Objective**: To control the order and dynamics of bubble and skyrmion lattices in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers by engineering stripe domains using in-plane magnetic fields.
- **Finding**: Applying a brief in-plane magnetic field to the stripe state significantly enhances both the frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) revealed that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. This demonstrates precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics and potentially topology by modifying the initial domain configuration.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate the formation of Neel-type skyrmions in thin layers of simple ferromagnetic alloys at high temperatures by imposing a vertical strain gradient.
- **Finding**: The study successfully observed Neel-type skyrmions in Co-Al and Co-Ni-Al alloys at temperatures up to 770 K. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** was used for direct observation of these skyrmions in freestanding membranes at high temperatures, while X-ray diffraction measured the strain gradient. This concept allows simple centrosymmetric ferromagnets with high magnetic ordering temperatures to exhibit hot skyrmions, thereby advancing skyrmionic electronics.

- **Authors**: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To conduct an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation and the short-to-long crack transition in a cold-worked 5052 aluminium alloy.
- **Finding**: The study performed an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation in 5052 aluminium alloy. **Scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC)** and **electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)** were used to characterize the microstructure and crack propagation. This allowed for the extraction of local stress intensity factors and energy release rates, correlating them with microstructural features. The findings establish that the short-to-long crack transition is governed by the process zone, where plastic deformation blunts the crack, rather than being length-scale governed.

- **Objective**: To investigate how substrate morphology can be used to control and reverse the strain state in V$_2$O$_3$ Mott insulator thin films, thereby tuning their phase transitions.
- **Finding**: The study found that minute changes in sapphire substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped) can reverse the dominant strain in V$_2$O$_3$ films from compressive (due to lattice mismatch) to tensile (due to thermal expansion mismatch). This control over strain significantly impacts the metal-insulator transition, leading to large differences in film resistivity. **High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM)** was used to elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism by imaging atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in the V$_2$O$_3$, offering a new mechanism to tune strain in thin films.

**41. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) can improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging by enabling continuously non-zero contrast transfer even in the presence of higher-order aberrations.
- **Finding**: This paper introduces aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) as an enhancement for dose-efficient tilt-corrected **four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)**.

The method was demonstrated on both simulated and experimental data, showing superior performance compared to tcBF or DPC methods alone, particularly by using the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens at Scherzer defocus to remove oscillations from the acBF CTF.

- **Authors**: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman
- **Date**: 2025-09-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the viability of image reconstruction in position-blind ptychography, where scan positions are unknown and must be recovered jointly with the image, using data-driven variational inference.
- **Finding**: This work explores position-blind ptychography, a novel inverse problem where scan positions are unknown, motivated by single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging. The study demonstrates that, with appropriate illumination structure and a strong data-driven prior (score-based diffusion models), reliable and successful image reconstructions can be achieved even under measurement noise. While this is an X-ray imaging technique, the principles of ptychography and advanced reconstruction are highly relevant to electron microscopy, particularly 4D-STEM, which also relies on diffraction patterns and probe positions.

- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayer heterostructures and determine if it arises from altermagnetic ordering in RuO$_2$ or interfacial chemical disorder.
- **Finding**: The study investigated the origin of exchange bias (EB) in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers, finding it is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing Fe$_3$O$_4$, rather than altermagnetic ordering in RuO$_2$. **Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM)**, along with polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron reflectometry, and SQUID measurements, was used to reveal the interfacial chemical disorder and the presence of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ interlayer, which undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments in Fe at low temperatures. This clarifies that EB alone cannot be considered evidence of altermagnetic ordering in rutile RuO$_2$.
