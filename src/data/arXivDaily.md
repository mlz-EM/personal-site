**3. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+δ}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates by investigating the structural and electronic properties of as-grown and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ polycrystals.
- **Finding**: Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers that suppress superconductivity. Multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) were crucial in revealing these atomic-scale structural changes and their electronic consequences, demonstrating a competition between interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity.

**11. [Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data by revisiting H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism, and to identify new imaging modes that can serve as fast approximations to ptychography.
- **Finding**: The study shows that tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) imaging modes, derived from the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk, enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) under the weak phase object approximation. It also identifies usable information in the dark field region, demonstrating a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums incoherent scattering components, holding promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM.

- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps.
- **Finding**: X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses revealed that pressing SCNCs into bulk pellets distorts the superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults. Crucially, heat treatment, at temperatures applied for organic crosslinking, significantly affects planar defects, causing stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes. In-situ STEM provided direct observation of these defect rearrangements at the supercrystalline scale, offering new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered nanoparticle assemblies.

**13. [Femtosecond Engineering of magnetic Domain Walls via Nonequilibrium Spin Textures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20701v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To directly image the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation.
- **Finding**: Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) combined with transient optical grating excitation enabled direct imaging of rapid DW formation within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state, and short-lived DWs that spontaneously vanish within picoseconds. Lorentz UEM provided the crucial real-time, high-resolution visualization of these non-equilibrium spin texture dynamics, revealing a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs, establishing a framework for femtosecond control of spin textures.

**14. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware statistical framework for assessing the recoverable signal in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, addressing the limitations of the conventional contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The SSNR framework, unlike CTF, accurately reflects practical performance by accounting for finite electron fluence and Poisson-limited detection, especially in low-dose regimes. Numerical reconstructions showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, while iterative ptychography shows a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography at low fluence and saturating at high fluence. This work highlights the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivates SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation, specifically testing this technique on Eu$^{3+}$ ions.
- **Finding**: The approach, utilizing spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses optimized for Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna, demonstrated a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition compared to conventional methods. While not a direct electron microscopy study, the "nanoscale sample engineering" aspect implies precise control over material morphology, which often relies on electron microscopy for characterization and quality assurance. This setup provides new opportunities for the spectroscopy of forbidden transitions.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the atomic-scale organization of dipoles within polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, aiming to understand the formation of ferroelectric domain walls.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in plan-view orientation revealed that within irreducibly narrow polar layers of ZrO$_2$, dipole organization is strikingly non-uniform, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls. STEM provided the crucial atomic-scale visualization and characterization of these head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls, which confine in-plane domains to a sub-nm$^2$ footprint, representing the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls nested within self-organized polar-nonpolar layering.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To precisely determine the atomic-scale distribution of hydrogen in metal hydrides, overcoming challenges posed by hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility, using advanced electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) successfully resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. MEP's exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning, demonstrated through experimental results, makes it a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.

- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements for direct ptychography by formulating parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, thereby enabling scan-upsampling.
- **Finding**: The study formulates parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, which allows for upsampling in direct ptychography and consequently relaxes its traditional resolution limitation tied to the probe step size. This work leverages insights from parallax imaging to improve direct ptychography's sampling efficiency, enabling the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave with less stringent sampling requirements, as demonstrated numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.

Zac Ward, Benjamin Lawrie, Guang Bian, James Burns, Jonathan D. Poplawsky, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Lucas Lindsay, Hu Miao, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Valentino R. Cooper, Matthew Brahlek
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: High structural quality and phase purity of MnTe polymorphs can be selectively grown on InP substrates: the altermagnetic hexagonal NiAs-structure on the (111)A (In-terminated) surface and the non-centrosymmetric cubic ZnS-structure on the (111)B (P-terminated) surface. Electron microscopy, along with photoemission spectroscopy and reflection high-energy electron diffraction, was used to confirm the phase selection and structural quality, indicating that the phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface.

- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To observe and understand how cumulative laser irradiation alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, linking microstructure to dynamic nucleation.
- **Finding**: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that repeated femtosecond and picosecond laser irradiation causes the phase transition in FeRh thin films to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation, leading to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned by underlying dislocation networks. The high structural and magnetic resolution of in-situ TEM was crucial for observing the formation and rearrangement of dislocation networks and their direct link to defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films using accelerator-based fast ion implantation.
- **Finding**: Fast ion implantation significantly enhanced the maximum NLMR in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films by over 100% compared to pristine films, while maintaining crystallinity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the crystallinity of the Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films after ion implantation, confirming that the enhancement in NLMR was achieved without significant degradation of the material's crystal structure, demonstrating the potential of high-energy ion implantation for chiralitronic functionalities.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) levitated in an optical trap.
- **Finding**: Functionalized SiNPs, optically trapped in vacuum, exhibited distinct oscillation frequency, width, and amplitude differences compared to non-functionalized SiNPs, allowing for selective detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on the particles, but it did not reveal any visual differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized particle types, highlighting the sensitivity of the optomechanical detection method in distinguishing subtle surface modifications.

- **Objective**: To develop an inverse modeling framework for Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to explicitly relate angular shifts to the strain and lattice rotation tensors, enabling reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$), and to perform sensitivity analysis.
- **Finding**: The study developed a computational framework for DFXM that allows for the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) using oblique diffraction geometry and provides methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific DFXM angles. While the paper focuses on X-ray methods, it positions DFXM as a complementary technique to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), which offer high spatial resolution but are limited to surface or thin samples, by enabling strain measurements deep inside bulk materials.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality in tetragonal tungsten bronzes K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and investigate the origin and switchability of their chirality.
- **Finding**: Both K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ exhibit ferrochirality, undergoing an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from P4/mbm to P4$_2$12(00$\gamma$)q00, with chirality originating from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms perpendicular to the c direction. High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures, confirming the phase transition and the helical displacement. This establishes tetragonal tungsten bronzes as a versatile playground for ferrochirality, with potential for electric-strain-field coupling to switch chirality.

-   **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
-   **Date**: 2025-07-23
-   **Objective**: Investigate the underlying mechanisms of undesired ablation during femtosecond laser irradiation of copper nanoparticles, focusing on fragmentation and coalescence.
-   **Finding**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a bimodal transformation in particle size distribution, showing the emergence of sub-60 nm debris and the formation of large aggregates up to 750 nm. The study identified hot electron blast, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and blast pressures above 4 GPa, as the dominant nonthermal ablation pathway, confirming that fs laser-induced ablation is driven predominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics rather than classical melting or evaporation.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-22
-   **Objective**: Investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
-   **Finding**: Cryogenic STEM revealed that after the first lithiation, the electrode showed a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li$_{15}$Si$_{4}$, various amorphous Li$_{x}$Si phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure was more uniform, with thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries, demonstrating that a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles.

-   **Authors**: B. Huang, Y. Q. Yang, M. H. Li, Y. X. Chen, X. Luo, M. S. Fu, Y. Chen, Xierong Zeng
-   **Date**: 2025-07-21
-   **Objective**: Investigate the local texture of three-stage CVD SiC fiber using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession electron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
-   **Finding**: PED on TEM confirmed the XRD results, showing that at the first deposition stage, the preferred direction of SiC grains was almost random with scattered grain sizes. At the second and third stages, two types of texture, (110) and (111), and (110) and (115), were observed. The grain size at these stages was about 200 nm, being lower at the third stage due to lower temperature, and the [110] preferred direction along the axial direction was found to be beneficial for axial tensile strength.
