**1. [Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497v1)**
-   **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
-   **Date**: 2025-09-10
-   **Objective**: To study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS$_2$) nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and explain recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations.
-   **Finding**: MD simulations revealed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes at nanoparticle edges, consistent with HR-TEM observations by Chen et al. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained this by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need for full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. The study also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials for accurate extrapolations.

-   **Finding**: A dual-branch multimodal VAE, trained on paired dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images, successfully predicted Au NR geometries (orientation and aspect ratio) using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. The VAE's performance for orientational angle prediction (MAE of 14.4, CCC of 0.95) was only marginally worse than the physics-based approach (MAE of 8.78, CCC of 0.99) with a small training set (300 particles). Electron microscopy images provided the crucial ground truth for training and validating the machine learning model.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-09
-   **Objective**: To demonstrate the tunable synthesis of the previously unreported 1T$'$ crystal phase of CrS$_2$ and 1T CrS$_2$ via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterize their structural and magnetic properties.
-   **Finding**: The study successfully synthesized 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ and 1T CrS$_2$, identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory, and 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction. 4D-STEM characterization revealed that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation from 1T to 1T$'$, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals. The 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperatures.

-   **Authors**: Menglin Zhu, Michael Xu, Louis Alaerts, Hao Pan, Colin Gilgenbach, Geoffroy Hautier, Lane W. Martin, James M. LeBeau
-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To directly resolve the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in PbZrO$_3$ thin films under device-relevant conditions using operando scanning transmission electron microscopy.
-   **Finding**: Operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with electric field biasing revealed a multi-step transition pathway involving several metastable phases. Atomic-resolution imaging, complemented by nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic-scale analysis, showed that this pathway and its end states can be modulated, leading to a "dead layer" near the substrate with suppressed switching. Dynamic phase transformations were observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases, driven by competing internal and external fields.

-   **Authors**: Jeffrey Huang, Yichao Zhang, Sang hyun Bae, Ballal Ahammed, Elif Ertekin, Pinshane Y. Huang
-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To map the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy to visualize out-of-plane deformations caused by defects and moiré reconstructions.
-   **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation was used to solve the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer accuracy. The resulting atomic models individually visualized each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in the interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies (exclusively in the outer Se planes). A new, unexpected type of structural disorder consisting of mixed bending- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations was also observed.

**6. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v1)**
-   **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and fracture mechanisms in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
-   **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging resulted in brittle fracture within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies showed intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology at crack initiation. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and later predominant brittle fracture with $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking. Electron backscatter diffraction studies on cross-sectional cracks supported the hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity. TEM observations explained the formation of river pattern features on the $\{100\}$ cleavage surface.

**7. [Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166v1)**
-   **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
-   **Date**: 2025-09-07
-   **Objective**: To investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand dopant self-organization and its effect on local structure within amorphous interfacial complexions.
-   **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and elemental analysis revealed chemical partitioning at both grain and interphase boundaries. The amorphous-crystalline transition region was notably enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others. Atomistic simulations, complemented by qualitative nanobeam electron diffraction, showed that increased grain boundary chemical complexity results in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure sensitive to dopant ratios.

-   **Authors**: A. Benhadjira, C. Detlefs, S. Borgi, V. Favre-Nicolin, C. Yildirim
-   **Date**: 2025-09-05
-   **Objective**: To automate the reliable identification of weak-beam versus strong-beam conditions in Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) for quantitative characterization of dislocations in bulk materials.
-   **Finding**: A deep learning framework utilizing a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) was introduced to automate the classification of imaging conditions in DFXM, which is typically a manual and subjective task. This CNN, trained on small, hand-labeled datasets, enables robust, rapid, and scalable identification of weak-beam conditions, which enhance dislocation contrast. This approach transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool, unlocking statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials, complementing atomic-scale insights often provided by electron microscopy.

-   **Authors**: Michael Hirler, Alexander A. Antonov, Enrico Baù, Andreas Aigner, Connor Heimig, Haiyang Hu, Andreas Tittl
-   **Date**: 2025-09-05
-   **Objective**: To develop an accessible, low-effort fabrication method for all-polymer metasurfaces supporting high quality factor resonances using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).
-   **Finding**: A bilayer recipe was developed using PMMA as the resonator material, eliminating complex multi-step fabrication and achieving high-quality nanopatterns by circumventing etching-induced defects. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the suspended membrane, confirming its high quality. Nanoindentation experiments with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip extracted position-dependent spring constant and pretension. The all-polymer metasurface experimentally delivered high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, demonstrating straightforward geometry-based tuning of linewidth and resonance position.

**10. [Dislocation interaction with a tilt low angle grain boundary in bi-crystal SrTiO3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04893v1)**
-   **Authors**: Kuan Ding, Atsutomo Nakamura, Patrick Cordier, Xufei Fang
-   **Date**: 2025-09-05
-   **Objective**: To understand the fundamental processes of dislocation-grain boundary (GB) interaction in a model bi-crystal SrTiO$_3$ system with a 4$^\circ$ tilt GB.
-   **Finding**: Room-temperature Brinell indentation generated a plastic zone at the mesoscale without crack formation. Dislocation etch pits imaging and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed dislocation pileup, storage, and transmission across the low-angle tilt GB, which consists of an array of edge dislocations. These experimental observations provide new insights into dislocation-GB interaction at room temperature at the mesoscale, which is critical for developing strategies for crack suppression in ceramics.

-   **Authors**: Tengfei Liu, Xiyu Hong, Zhe Li, Shenzhong Chen, Leyi Li, Xin-Yi Tang, Shuying Cheng, Yunfeng Lai, Yonghai Chen, Zhu Diao, Ke He, Qi-kun Xue, Jinling Yu
-   **Date**: 2025-09-04
-   **Objective**: To investigate thickness-driven topological phase transitions in $\alpha$-Sn films of varying thickness grown on CdTe(110) using helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC).
-   **Finding**: HDPC measurements showed an odd-function dependence on incident angle for the 5 nm $\alpha$-Sn film, contrasting with an even-function dependence for 10 and 30 nm films. Combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, this revealed a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a 2D to a 3D topological insulator occurring between 5 and 10 nm. HR-TEM was crucial for characterizing the film structure and quality, supporting the interpretation of the observed electronic properties.

**12. [Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03220v1)**
-   **Authors**: Jörn Bonse
-   **Date**: 2025-09-03
-   **Objective**: To review the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses, with a focus on ultrafast optical probing and imaging schemes.
-   **Finding**: This chapter provides a comprehensive review of ultrafast optical methods, such as pump-probe techniques and various imaging schemes (e.g., photography, microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, coherent diffractive imaging), for analyzing laser-based material processing. These methods are capable of analyzing a plethora of processes, including heating, melting, ablation, and surface restructuring, on microscopic to macroscopic scales. While the chapter focuses on optical techniques, the insights gained from such ultrafast probing are often complemented by post-mortem electron microscopy for detailed structural characterization of the laser-processed materials.

**13. [Fidelity-preserving enhancement of ptychography with foundational text-to-image models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04513v1)**
-   **Authors**: Ming Du, Volker Rose, Junjing Deng, Dileep Singh, Si Chen, Mathew J. Cherukara
-   **Date**: 2025-09-02
-   **Objective**: To develop a plug-and-play (PnP) framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided image editing using foundational diffusion models to enhance ptychography by removing artifacts.
-   **Finding**: The proposed PnP framework, utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts in natural language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets showed significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction pattern consistency, directly improving the output of electron ptychography.

**14. [Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00943v1)**
-   **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
-   **Date**: 2025-08-31
-   **Objective**: To apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te phase-change materials.
-   **Finding**: Unsupervised machine learning, including PCA for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering, was applied to 4D-STEM data from Ge-Sb-Te alloys. Four distinct clusters were identified and mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures (e.g., oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, germanium in Cluster 4) and averaged diffraction patterns confirmed structural variations across these clusters. This demonstrates that clustering analysis of 4D-STEM data provides a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in phase-change materials.

**15. [Investigation of structure and anisotropic electrical resistivity in single-crystalline CoSn kagome metal thin films for interconnect applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21711v1)**
-   **Authors**: Tomoya Nakatani, Nattamon Suwannaharn, Taisuke Sasaki
-   **Date**: 2025-08-29
-   **Objective**: To fabricate CoSn kagome metal thin films by magnetron sputtering, investigate their crystallographic orientation and structure, and characterize their anisotropic electrical resistivity for interconnect applications.
-   **Finding**: Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films was achieved on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer at deposition temperatures above 350 $^\circ$C. The films exhibited low resistivity along [0001] and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of resistivity between [0001] and [2-1-10], consistent with bulk CoSn. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films, highlighting both the potential and challenges for interconnect applications.

**16. [Molecular Beam Epitaxy of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21537v1)**
-   **Authors**: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
-   **Date**: 2025-08-29
-   **Objective**: To epitaxially grow 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and characterize their structural and electronic properties.
-   **Finding**: High substrate growth temperature (825$^\circ$C) induced optimal structural properties for the 2H-TaS$_2$ overlayer, which grew unstrained after monolayer deposition. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provided evidence of pits at the interface, most probably due to GaN thermal decomposition at high growth temperatures. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy showed electron transfer from n-GaN(0001) to 2H-TaS$_2$ and nitrogen vacancy formation near the interface, but no chemical reaction, corroborating the possibility of integrating 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with GaN.

**17. [Titanium for rare-event searches: Hydrofluoric acid-free etching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21029v1)**
-   **Authors**: P. Knights, K. Nikolopoulos, G. Rogers, D. Spathara, P. Walters
-   **Date**: 2025-08-28
-   **Objective**: To develop an alternative hydrofluoric acid-free chemical etching method for titanium to remove surface deposits, aiming to improve safety for rare-event search experiments.
-   **Finding**: A sulphuric acid-based etching method was demonstrated to effectively etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\mu$m of material from the surface over 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the surface and contamination, confirming the removal of surface contaminants after etching. This proposed method offers a potential, safer alternative to conventional hydrofluoric acid etching for preparing radiopure titanium for sensitive experiments.

-   **Authors**: Chenyang Yin, Lei Cao, Xue Bai, Suqin He, Hengbo Zhang, Tomas Duchon, Felix Gunkel, Yunxia Zhou, Mao Wang, Anton Kaus, Janghyun Jo, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Shengqiang Zhou, Thomas Brückel, Oleg Petracic
-   **Date**: 2025-08-28
-   **Objective**: To induce and characterize a topotactic phase transition from Perovskite (PV) to Brownmillerite (BM) in epitaxial La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3-\delta}$ films using an oxygen getter assisted thermal annealing method.
-   **Finding**: An efficient thermal vacuum annealing method using aluminum as an oxygen getter successfully triggered the PV to BM topotactic phase transition in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3-\delta}$ thin films, confirmed by X-ray Diffraction. This transition was accompanied by a change from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic and metallic to insulating states. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) revealed surface segregation and cation redistribution during the oxygen getter assisted annealing process, providing atomic-scale insights into the structural changes driving the property modifications.

**19. [Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20930v1)**
-   **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
-   **Date**: 2025-08-28
-   **Objective**: To investigate the control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films by balancing epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry.
-   **Finding**: Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that large anisotropic compressive strain promotes ferroelectric domain formation, despite the expected stabilization of uniform out-of-plane polarization by the metallic buffer's charged surface. The resulting nanoscale domain architecture was stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the buffer-imposed polarization. STEM was crucial for atomic-scale imaging of the domain architecture and interfacial layers, providing insights into the mechanisms for controlling polarization direction and chiral textures.

**20. [Prediction of EDS Maps from 4DSTEM Diffraction Patterns Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20657v1)**
-   **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
-   **Date**: 2025-08-28
-   **Objective**: To develop a machine learning framework that predicts energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps directly from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, aiming to reduce beam exposure and acquisition time in materials characterization.
-   **Finding**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to accurately infer elemental compositions from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations like Oxygen and Tellurium. Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies demonstrated consistent performance. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirmed the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends, establishing a data-driven pathway for non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization by effectively combining structural information from 4D-STEM with predicted chemical information.

**21. [Toughening beta-Ga2O3 via mechanically seeded dislocations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20439v1)**
-   **Authors**: Zanlin Cheng, Jiawen Zhang, Peng Gao, Guosong Zeng, Xufei Fang, Wenjun Lu
-   **Date**: 2025-08-28
-   **Objective**: To explore a new approach for improving the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching.
-   **Finding**: Surface scratching along the [100] direction effectively generated edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for surface morphology analysis and microstructural characterization. These techniques revealed that the introduced dislocations significantly mitigated the formation of cleavage cracks during nanoindentation, facilitating stable plastic deformation in contrast to as-received $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. TEM was essential for identifying the type and location of the mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers.

**22. [3D Strain Field Reconstruction by Inversion of Dynamical Scattering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18897v1)**
-   **Authors**: Laura Niermann, Tore Niermann, Chengyu Song, Colin Ophus
-   **Date**: 2025-08-26
-   **Objective**: To present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects.
-   **Finding**: A novel method for 3D strain field reconstruction was developed, leveraging the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects observed in 4D-STEM data, which arise from strain field variations along the electron beam direction. The method was tested against simulated data with known ground truth and successfully applied to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer. This approach addresses a major challenge in (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) by enabling the measurement of strain variations along the electron beam direction.

**23. [Atomistic Structure of Transient Switching States in Ferroelectric AlScN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18241v1)**
-   **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
-   **Date**: 2025-08-25
-   **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced thin-film fabrication, ferroelectric switching dynamics characterizations, and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that broad transitional regions previously observed in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images during polarization switching are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic 3D zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, not transient nonpolar intermediate phases. This was further confirmed by STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Simulations revealed switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, consistent with nucleation-limited switching behavior and explaining the zigzag-shaped domain walls.

**24. [Crystalline-to-Crystalline Phase Transition between Germanium Selenide Polymorphs with High Resistance Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17997v1)**
-   **Authors**: Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim
-   **Date**: 2025-08-25
-   **Objective**: To investigate the crystalline-to-crystalline phase transition between GeSe polymorphs induced by either global annealing or localized laser-induced heating, and to characterize their structural and electronic properties.
-   **Finding**: The highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe transformed into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to investigate the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface. TEM analysis supported the proposed mechanism that clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures drives the transition, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through minor GeSe$_2$ phase segregation. A high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$ was observed between the two phases.

**25. [Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17085v1)**
-   **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
-   **Date**: 2025-08-23
-   **Objective**: To investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations within the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand its underlying mechanisms.
-   **Finding**: Compression tests revealed a novel cross-slip of Shockley partial dislocations ($a/6<112>$) from one $\{111\}$ plane to another $\{111\}$ conjugate plane, facilitated by stair-rod dislocation formation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize defects (stacking faults, dislocations) and associated chemical fluctuations. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies, while local stress concentrations also played a critical role.

- **Authors**: Wiebe Stolp, Silvia Cipiccia, Darren Batey, Matthieu Boone
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: This paper aims to analyze and propose alternative optics for broadband x-ray ptychography to maximize photon detection rates and broaden the tolerable bandwidth, addressing limitations of current monochromatic setups and detector saturation.
- **Finding**: The paper analyzes the challenges of current x-ray ptychography, particularly the limitations of Fresnel zone plates and detector saturation with broadband illumination. While not directly using electron microscopy, it discusses the *optics* for an x-ray imaging technique that is analogous to electron ptychography (a scanning transmission electron microscopy technique, as seen in paper 37), aiming to improve resolution and spectral information acquisition. The proposed solutions aim to enable higher-rate spectral imaging and transition x-ray ptychography into a laboratory technique, which would significantly enhance its accessibility and utility for materials characterization.

- **Authors**: Michael Deimetry, Timothy C. Petersen, Matthew Weyland, Scott D. Findlay
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Objective**: This research aims to demonstrate that core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of small concentrations of dopants in crystal structures.
