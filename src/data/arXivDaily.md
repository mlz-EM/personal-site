- **Finding**: A novel method was presented for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM, based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects that occur at strain field variations along the electron beam direction. The method was successfully tested against simulated data and demonstrated on an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer, addressing a major challenge in (S)TEM for measuring strain variations along the beam direction.

**35. [Atomistic Structure of Transient Switching States in Ferroelectric AlScN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18241v1)**
- **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations revealed that previously observed broad transitional regions in AlScN are projection artifacts of intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag 180$^\circ$ domain walls, rather than a transient nonpolar intermediate phase. STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films confirmed this, demonstrating that switching proceeds via collective, column-by-column atomic displacements.

- **Authors**: Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by annealing or localized laser heating, and their electrical properties.
