**1. [Superconductor-insulator transitions in infinite-layer nickelates controlled via ${operando}$ monitored reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14072v1)
- **Authors**: Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Wei Lv, Xianfeng Wu, Guangdi Zhou, Zihao Nie, Yueying Li, Cui Ding, Danfeng Li, Hongtao Yuan, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To achieve continuous control over the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors using an *operando* monitored reduction (OMR) method and study the resulting electronic phases.
- **Finding**: OMR enabled ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the $\text{Ni } 3d$ orbital electron occupancy from $\sim 3d^7$ to $\sim 3d^9$. **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) Annular Bright Field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms**, combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), was crucial for accurately calibrating the $3d$ occupancy. Transport measurements showed that pairing initiates at the onset of the resistive drop, and the observed SIT deviates from the canonical 2D model, exhibiting a mixture of 2D and 3D superconducting characters.

**2. [Nanoparticle Self-assembly Assisted by Polymers: The Role of Shear Stress in the Nanoparticle Arrangement of Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13842v1)
- **Authors**: Beatriz Martín-García, M. Mercedes Velázquez
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To investigate how shear stress, induced by compression-expansion cycles, influences the polymer-assisted self-assembly and arrangement of $\text{CdSe}$ quantum dots ($\text{QDs}$) in Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett ($\text{LB}$) films.
- **Finding**: Shear stress removes nanoparticles from metastable states at the air-water interface, promoting a new, more ordered equilibrium state in the Langmuir monolayer. The morphology of the resulting $\text{LB}$ films was analyzed by **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)**, showing that increased amplitude strain leads to decreased $\text{QD}$ domain size and improved film order.

**3. [Influence of Ru content on electrocatalytic activity and defect formation of Au-Pd-Pt-Ru compositionally complex solid solution thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13803v1)
- **Authors**: Miran Joo, Huixin Xiu, Sabrina Baha, Ridha Zerdoumi, Ningyan Cheng, Christoph Somsen, Yujiao Li, Aleksander Kostka, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Alfred Ludwig, Christina Scheu
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To correlate the $\text{Ru}$ content with defect formation and electrocatalytic activity in $\text{Au-Pd-Pt-Ru}$ compositionally complex solid solution ($\text{CCSS}$) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing $\text{Ru}$ content caused lattice contraction and a transition in defect structure from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults. **Electron microscopy equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)** was used for high-throughput compositional and microstructural characterization. Atom Probe Tomography ($\text{APT}$) further revealed local compositional fluctuations and element segregation at grain boundaries. The hydrogen evolution reaction activity improved significantly with higher $\text{Ru}$ content.

**4. [Near-atomic investigation on the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nano-sized kappa phase and B2 phase in an Al-alloyed lightweight steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13721v1)
- **Authors**: Bowen Zou, Yixu Wang, Xiao Shen, Philipp Krooss, Thomas Niendorf, Richard Dronskowski, Wenwen Song
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To reveal the elemental redistribution mechanisms during the co-precipitation of nanosized $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ phases in an $\text{Al}$-alloyed $\text{Fe-Mn-Ni-C}$ steel.
- **Finding**: Correlative **Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD)-Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** and **Atom Probe Tomography (APT)** identified two co-nanoprecipitation modes. $\text{APT}$ showed that $\text{B}2$ precipitates adjacent to $\kappa$ ($\text{B}2\text{I}$) are $\text{FeAl}$-type, while isolated $\text{B}2$ precipitates ($\text{B}2\text{II}$) are $\text{NiAl}$-type. DFT calculations confirmed that $\text{Fe-Ni}$ atomic exchange between $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ is thermodynamically favorable, driving the $\text{B}2$ phase evolution towards the more stable $\text{FeAl}$ type during co-precipitation.

**5. [Towards reliable electrical measurements of superconducting devices inside a transmission electron microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13298v1)
- **Authors**: Joachim Dahl Thomsen, Michael I. Faley, Joseph Vimal Vas, Alexander Clausen, Thibaud Denneulin, Dominik Biscette, Denys Sutter, Peng-Han Lu, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To establish a reliable methodology for performing electrical transport measurements on superconducting devices inside a Transmission Electron Microscope ($\text{TEM}$) at liquid helium temperatures.
- **Finding**: Reliable electrical transport measurements of $\text{NbN}$ devices were demonstrated inside the $\text{TEM}$ using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder, achieving an estimated base sample temperature of $8-9 \text{ K}$. The critical contribution was the optimization of a thermal radiation shield to limit radiation from the objective lens pole pieces. The study also showed that both electron beam imaging and the objective lens magnetic field perturb the superconducting state when the base temperature is close to the critical temperature ($\text{T}_{\text{c}}$).

**6. [Discovery of Ferroelectric Twin Boundaries in a Photoactive Halide Perovskite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12892v1)
- **Authors**: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To discover and characterize the existence and functional properties of ferroelastic twin boundaries in photoactive halide perovskite ($\text{CsPbI}_3$) thin films.
- **Finding**: **Low-dose Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** directly revealed ferroelastic twin boundaries parallel to $\{110\}$ and $\{112\}$. Crucially, at $\{110\}$ twin boundaries, $\text{Pb}$ atoms shift, driving a local ferroelectric-like polarization, creating an intrinsic array of nanoscale polar interfaces within the bulk non-polar lattice. In contrast, $\{112\}$ boundaries remain non-polar but suppress octahedral tilt, uncovering previously hidden ferroic functionality amenable to domain wall engineering.

- **Authors**: Soumi Mondal, Sreekant Anil, Saurav Islam, Yingdong Guan, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Aaron Pearre, Sandra Santhosh, Nasim Alem, Nitin Samarth, Zhiqiang Mao
- **Date**: 2026-01-18
- **Objective**: To synthesize large, high-quality $\alpha-\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ single crystals with significantly reduced carrier density using a $\text{Se}$-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique.
- **Finding**: The modified Bridgman method, utilizing high pressure and $\text{Se}$-flux, successfully grew pure $\alpha-\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ single crystals with $3\text{R}$ stacking. **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** and **Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)** confirmed the single phase and composition. The crystals exhibited a remarkably low carrier density ($1.5-3.2 \times 10^{16} \text{ cm}^{-3}$), indicating a significant suppression of $\text{Se}$-vacancies (intrinsic defects) relative to conventional growth methods.

**8. [Electric Charge Transport and Dielectric Properties of the Barium Titanate Ceramics Obtained by Spark-Plasma Sintering with Different Controlled Carbon Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12060v1)
- **Authors**: Oleksandr S. Pylypchuk, Victor V. Vainberg, Denis O. Stetsenko, Oleksii V. Bereznikov, Taisiia O. Kuzmenko, Serhii E. Ivanchenko, Bohdan Pokhylko, Vladyslav Kushnir, Lesya Demchenko, Volodimir N. Poroshin, Victor I. Styopkin, Anna N. Morozovska
- **Date**: 2026-01-17
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of controlled carbon content on the electric charge transport and colossal dielectric properties of $\text{BaTiO}_3$ ceramics synthesized by spark-plasma sintering ($\text{SPS}$).
- **Finding**: The conduction mechanism in the ceramics is determined by variable range hopping, obeying the Mott law. **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)** was used to characterize the concentration and distribution of the carbon impurity. The ceramics exhibit colossal relative dielectric permittivity (up to $10^5 - 10^6$). Higher carbon concentration correlated with decreased permittivity and resistivity in the Mott conduction temperature range, supporting the validity of the Heywang model for describing the conduction mechanisms.

- **Date**: 2026-01-16
- **Objective**: To grow two-dimensional ($\text{2D}$) flakes of $\text{ReSe}_2$ using chemical vapor deposition ($\text{CVD}$) and characterize their structural, morphological, and optical properties.
- **Finding**: $\text{ReSe}_2$ flakes with thicknesses of $5-50 \text{ nm}$ were successfully grown. **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)** and **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)** were used to investigate the morphology and crystal structure. **Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS)** confirmed the $1:2$ elemental composition. Optical measurements identified excitonic peaks used to define the band gap, consistent with DFT predictions (indirect bulk gap of $0.88 \text{ eV}$ and direct monolayer gap of $1.26 \text{ eV}$).

**10. [Unexpected Anisotropic Mn-Sb Anti-site Distribution and Van der Waals Epitaxy of MnSb2Te4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11353v1)
- **Authors**: Gustavo Chavez Ponce de Leon, Ahmad Dibajeh, Gert ten Brink, Majid Ahmadi, Bart Jan Kooi, George Palasantzas
- **Date**: 2026-01-16
- **Objective**: To investigate the distribution of $\text{Mn-Sb}$ anti-site mixing in $\text{MnSb}_2\text{Te}_4$ and develop a method for its Van der Waals epitaxy on $\text{SiOx}$.
- **Finding**: **High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-STEM)** combined with **Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)** revealed an inversion-breaking asymmetry in the anti-site distribution, suggesting an anisotropic structure similar to Janus materials. The successful Van der Waals epitaxy of $\text{MnSb}_2\text{Te}_4$ over $\text{Sb}_2\text{Te}_3$ seeds on amorphous $\text{SiOx}$ using Pulsed Laser Deposition was confirmed using **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)**, paving the way for Si-based integration.

**11. [Noise2Void for Denoising Atomic Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07699v1)
- **Authors**: William Thornley, Sam Sullivan-Allsop, Rongsheng Cai, Nick Clark, Roman Gorbachev, Sarah J. Haigh
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and quantify the effectiveness of the Noise2Void technique for denoising atomic-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy ($\text{STEM}$) images and videos.
- **Finding**: The Noise2Void technique successfully denoised atomic resolution **STEM** images and videos of gold adatoms on a graphene surface, qualitatively improving the visibility of both the $\text{Au}$ adatoms and the graphene lattice. Quantified comparison against simulated data showed that this approach significantly outperforms traditional methods like total variation and Gaussian blurring, offering the advantage of requiring no manual intervention or prior sample knowledge, while being compatible with real-time data acquisition rates ($> 45$ frames per second).

**12. [Physics-embedded neural computational electron microscopy for quantitative 4D nanometrology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07311v1)
- **Authors**: Hao-Jin Wang, Liqun Shen, Xin-Ning Tian, Lei Lei, Kexin Wang, Grigore Moldovan, Marc-Georg Willinger, Zhu-Jun Wang
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To develop a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that integrates a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning for quantitative 4D nanometrology.
- **Finding**: By employing a Vision Field Transformer as a high-speed, differentiable surrogate for physical process analysis, the framework achieves single-shot, quantitative three-dimensional reconstruction using **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)** with precision comparable to $\text{AFM}$ but at much higher throughput. This synergy enabled $4\text{D}$ *in situ* characterization, tracking the dynamic evolution of surface nanostructure during copper redox and revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics.

**13. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) is varied, focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: **High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)** confirmed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ decreased below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This structural evolution coincided with a divergence in anomalous Hall resistivity ($\rho_{\text{A,h,s}}$). The AHE scaling relation revealed a crossover of the AHE mechanism: from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution in thick films ($t_{\text{Fe}} > 30 \text{ \AA}$) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism ($n = 0.62$) in the high-resistive, percolative films ($t_{\text{Fe}} \le 30 \text{ \AA}$).

**14. [Absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 revealed by X-ray linear dichroism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06791v1)
- **Authors**: Siyu Wang, Chao Wang, Yanan Yuan, Jiangxiao Li, Fangfang Pei, Daxiang Liu, Chunyu Qin, Jiefeng Cao, Yamei Wang, Tianye Wang, Jiayu Liu, Jieun Lee, Guanhua Zhang, Christoph Klewe, Chenchao Yu, Fan Zhang, Dongsheng Song, Kai Chen, Weisheng Zhao, Dawei Shen, Ziqiang Qiu, Mengmeng Yang, Bin Hong, Qian Li
- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To definitively determine the presence or absence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ films, a promising altermagnetic candidate, using X-ray linear dichroism ($\text{XLD}$).
- **Finding**: The observed $\text{XLD}$ signal was nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field direction, directly contradicting the substantial magnetic order-related $\text{XLD}$ signal predicted by multiple scattering calculations. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for $\text{RuO}_2$. Distinct $\text{XLD}$ signals observed at different substrate orientations were attributed to low-symmetry crystal fields. (Note: The abstract focuses on XLD/PEEM and calculation, with no direct contribution from conventional electron microscopy techniques mentioned.)

- **Authors**: Yorick A. Birkhölzer, Anna S. Park, Noah Schnitzer, Jeffrey Z. Kaaret, Benjamin Z. Gregory, Tomas A. Kraay, Tobias Schwaigert, Matthew R. Barone, Brendan D. Faeth, Felix V. E. Hensling, Iris C. G. van den Bosch, Ellen M. Kiens, Christoph Baeumer, Enrico Bergamasco, Markus Grüninger, Alexander Bordovalos, Suresh Chaulagain, Nikolas J.

Benedek, Andrej Singer, David A. Muller, Darrell G. Schlom
- **Date**: 2026-01-10
- **Objective**: To stabilize and characterize epitaxial thin films of the metastable tantalum dioxide ($\text{TaO}_2$) using suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy ($\text{MBE}$) and thermal laser epitaxy ($\text{TLE}$).
- **Finding**: Single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained $\text{TaO}_2$ films was achieved on $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ substrates. Microstructural investigation was performed using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)**. The tetravalent oxidation state was confirmed using X-ray absorption, photoemission spectroscopy, and **Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS)**. The films exhibited a $0.3 \text{ eV}$ Mott gap, suggesting the potential for a structural phase transition akin to $\text{NbO}_2$.

**16. [The role of ZnO/ZnS nanostructures decoration of Ni foam on the electrochemical energy storage process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06509v1)
- **Authors**: Alessia Fischetti, Giacometta Mineo, Daniela Russo, Francesco Salutari, Claudio Lentini Campallegio, Elena Bruno, Jordi Arbiol, Giorgia Franzò, Salvatore Mirabella, Vincenzina Strano, M. Chiara Spadaro
- **Date**: 2026-01-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the electrochemical energy storage mechanism of hydrothermally grown $\text{ZnO}/\text{ZnS}$ nanostructures decorating $\text{Ni}$ foam ($\text{NF}$) substrates.
- **Finding**: The system based on $\text{NF}$ exhibited a predominant pseudocapacitive behavior, significantly outperforming the same nanostructures on graphene paper ($\text{GP}$). **Electron microscopy-based methodologies** were employed to evaluate the morphology, structure, and composition of the nanostructures. Mott-Schottky measurements suggested that the presence of a hole reservoir in the $\text{ZnS}$ decoration is key to boosting the electrochemical performance of the $\text{NF}$ system.

**17. [On the Feasibility of Extreme Heating Rates in SEM using MEMS Heater Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05831v1)
- **Authors**: C. Koenig, P. Mayr, J. R. Jinschek, A. Bastos Fanta
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the feasibility of using micro-electro-mechanical system ($\text{MEMS}$) heating platforms for *in situ* Scanning Electron Microscopy ($\text{SEM}$) characterization of microstructural evolution under extreme, Additive Manufacturing ($\text{AM}$)-relevant thermal cycling.
- **Finding**: Stable heating and cooling rates up to $1000 \text{ C/s}$ were achieved in vacuum without degrading **Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD)** pattern quality. $\text{EBSD}$ was successfully used to track the ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation in pure iron, confirming accurate temperature control. This establishes $\text{MEMS}$-based heating as a robust approach for quantitative *in situ* $\text{SEM}$ studies of rapid, thermally activated phenomena.

- **Authors**: Callum Brennan-Rich, Sean M. Collins, Stuart Micklethwaite, Zabeada Aslam, Trevor Almeida, Stephen McVitie, Rik M. Drummond-Brydson, Christopher H. Marrows
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize the structural and magnetic properties of epitaxial $\text{Fe-Sn}$ kagome thin films, including the frustrated ferromagnet $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$ and the antiferromagnet $\text{FeSn}$.
- **Finding**: High-quality epitaxial thin films of $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$, $\text{FeSn}$, and mixed-phase intergrowths were successfully produced. The crystallographic phase content was characterized using X-ray methods and **Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM)**. Magnetization measurements corresponded well with the predicted ferromagnetic phase content, and a unique temperature-dependent coercivity behavior was discovered specifically within the highly mixed phase alloys.

**19. [NiTi Single Crystal Growth by Micro-Pulling-Down Method: Experimental Setup and Material Characterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05645v1)
- **Authors**: Timon Sieweke, Chris Luther, Martin Wortmann, Lauritz Schnatmann, Felicitas Werner, Olga Kuschel, Laila Bondzio, Inga Ennen, Judith Bünte, Karsten Rott, Oluwaseyi Oluwabi, Moritz Loewenich, Joachim Wollschläger, Andreas Hütten, Jan Frenzel, Gabi Schierning, Alexander Kunzmann
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To set up a micro-pulling-down ($\mu\text{PD}$) apparatus for growing high-quality $\text{NiTi}$ single crystals and perform comprehensive material characterization.
- **Finding**: The $\mu\text{PD}$ method successfully produced $\text{NiTi}$ single crystals with reduced oxygen contamination. Detailed characterization included **Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD)** and **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)** for structural and morphological analysis, and **Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)** for compositional analysis, confirming the material properties necessary for studying the sensitive austenite-to-martensite phase transition.

**20. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\alpha-\text{Mn}$ precipitate size and volume fraction during room temperature high-pressure torsion ($\text{HPT}$) in an ultrafine-grained $\text{Mg-Mn}$ alloy.
- **Finding**: The volume fraction of $\text{nm}$-scale $\alpha-\text{Mn}$ particles increased with applied strain. Analysis of the precipitate size distribution using **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)**, combined with SAXS/WAXS, determined that the mean particle size did not increase during $\text{HPT}$. This lack of growth, despite increasing volume fraction, suggests that precipitate evolution is subject to interfacial control rather than being limited by manganese diffusivity.

**21. [Cross-hatch strain effects on SiGe quantum dots for qubit variability estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05553v1)
- **Authors**: Luis Fabián Peña, Mitchell I. Brickson, Fabrizio Rovaris, J. Houston Dycus, Anthony McDonald, Zachary T. Piontkowski, Joel Benjamin Ruzindana, Adelaide M. Bradicich, Don Bethke, Robin Scott, Thomas E. Beechem, Francesco Montalenti, N. Tobias Jacobson, Ezra Bussmann
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To quantify the influence of residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity from virtual substrates ($\text{VS}$) on the interface structure and variability of $\text{SiGe}$ quantum dots used for spin qubits.
- **Finding**: Correlative imaging using Raman microscopy, **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)**, and **Cross-sectional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** revealed the spatial interplay between strain and interface roughness. Modeling indicated that the measured strain variations could result in spurious double-dot qubit detunings of $0.1 \text{ meV}$ over $100 \text{ nm}$ distances. The results suggest that using thicker $\text{VS}$ buffer layers and lower growth temperatures ($\text{T} \le 700^{\circ}\text{C}$) can limit interface roughening.

**22. [Layered CrGe1-xSe3+y with Cr Kagome Lattice and Antiferromagnetic Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05360v1)
- **Authors**: Jeremy G. Philbrick, Chaoguo Wang, Xin Gui, Tai Kong
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a new layered material, $\text{CrGe}_{1-\text{x}}\text{Se}_{3+\text{y}}$.
- **Finding**: The crystal structure was determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction and **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)**, confirming the space group $R\bar{3}m$ with a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms sandwiched between disordered $\text{Ge-Se}$ layers. The compound exhibits antiferromagnetic order below $50 \text{ K}$, contrasting with the ferromagnetic behavior of $\text{CrGeTe}_3$. The effective magnetic moment is consistent with $\text{Cr}^{3+}$ oxidation.

- **Authors**: Jaeyel Lee, Dieter Isheim, Zuhawn Sung, Francesco Crisa, Sabrina Garattoni, Mustafa Bal, Cameron J. Kopas, Josh Y. Mutus, Hilal Cansizoglu, Jayss Marshall, Kameshwar Yadavalli, Dominic P. Goronzy, Mark C. Hersam, David N. Seidman, Alex Romanenko, Anna Grassellino, Akshay A. Murthy
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analysis of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries ($\text{GBs}$) in $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}$-encapsulated $\text{Nb}$ thin films relevant for superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: **Atom-Probe Tomography (APT)** and **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** revealed significant oxygen segregation at $\text{GBs}$ in both $\text{Nb}$ and $\text{Ta}/\text{Nb}$ films. The oxygen enrichment factor ($C_{\text{gb}}/C_{\text{grain}}$) was $2.7$ for $\text{Nb}$ films, slightly reduced to $2.3$ in $\text{Ta}$-capped films. A correlation was established where increased oxygen concentration in both $\text{Nb}$ grains and $\text{GBs}$ suppresses the superconducting critical temperature ($\text{T}_{\text{c}}$), providing atomic-scale insight into potential decoherence mechanisms.

**24. [Correlative Ultrafast Imaging of a Propagating Photo-Driven Phase Transition Using 4D STEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05018v1)
- **Authors**: Arthur Niedermayr, Jianyu Wu, Bertina Fisher, Ido Kaminer, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To utilize correlative ultrafast imaging via $4\text{D}$ Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy ($4\text{D}$ $\text{STEM}$) to directly probe the spatiotemporal propagation dynamics of a photo-driven phase transition in $\text{VO}_2$.
- **Finding**: Ultrafast $4\text{D}$ $\text{STEM}$ successfully enabled virtual imaging and strain mapping across space and time. This direct imaging capability recorded the propagation of the laser-excited insulator-metal transition in $\text{VO}_2$ on picosecond timescales. The correlation revealed how atomic-scale symmetry breaking inherently generates lattice distortions that propagate to govern macroscopic property changes, providing new insights into non-equilibrium responses in correlated oxides.

- **Authors**: Louis Alaerts, Jesse Schimpf, Xinyan Li, Jiongzhi Zheng, Ella Banyas, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Sinéad M. Griffin, Yimo Han, Lane W. Martin, Geoffroy Hautier
- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To computationally predict, synthesize, and characterize a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, focusing on $\text{La}_3\text{NbO}_7$.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial $\text{La}_3\text{NbO}_7$ thin films were synthesized, exhibiting the signature double hysteresis loops characteristic of an antiferroelectric. **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** provided clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure, confirming the theoretical prediction. The material combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx 6 \text{ MV/cm}$), making this new weberite-type family promising for energy storage applications.

**26. [Ultrafast laser-driven topological phase patterning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03881v1)**
- **Authors**: Jianyu Wu, Arthur Niedermayr, Gaolong Cao, Oscar Grånäs, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ultrafast, spatially selective, and reversible patterning of topological quantum states in the Weyl semimetal $\mathrm{WTe}_{2}$ using femtosecond laser excitation.
- **Finding**: They successfully engineered a transient optical grating to spatially and reversibly drive phase transitions between the topological $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{d}}$ and trivial $1 \mathrm{~T}^{*}$ phases, creating a periodic $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{d}} / 1 \mathrm{~T}^{*}$ heterostructure. **Ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM)** provided direct visualization of the heterostructure formation, observation of the phase front propagation, and analysis of the nanoscale confinement of coherently excited optical phonon modes.

**27. [Structural heterogeneity-induced enhancement of transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion revealed by thermoelectric imaging in functionally graded materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03581v1)**
- **Authors**: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To investigate how graded structural heterogeneity in functionally graded materials (FGMs) influences transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion.
- **Finding**: A pronounced non-monotonic enhancement of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (transverse charge-to-heat conversion) was observed in the atomic-heterogeneity regime prior to full crystallization. Structural analyses using **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** and atom probe tomography revealed that this enhancement is caused by $\mathrm{Fe}$-based crystalline alloys and $\mathrm{Cu}$ nanoclusters embedded within the amorphous matrix.

- **Authors**: Asato Onishi, Zifan Xu, Cédric Bareille, Yoichi Kageyama, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Toshiyuki Taniuchi, Takasada Shibauchi
- **Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Objective**: To visualize the energy dependence of electronic nematicity and orbital anisotropy in real space within the Fe-based superconductor $\mathrm{Ba}_{1-x} \mathrm{Na}_{x} \mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{As}_{2}$.
- **Finding**: Using 5.82-eV laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM), they visualized the evolution of linear dichroic (LD) contrast, discovering a sign reversal of the LD contrast at an energy $\sim 0.4 \ \mathrm{eV}$ below the Fermi level.

- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop a full quantum theory describing the interaction between free electrons and light, specifically incorporating two-photon processes and clarifying the relationship with PINEM, Kapitza-Dirac (KD), and nonlinear Compton scattering effects.

- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a direct and controllable method for recovering the intrinsic metallic surface of $\mathrm{SrVO}_{3}$ (SVO) by thermally reducing the oxidized near-surface region (NSR) under ultra-high vacuum.
