- **Finding**: X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy confirmed a pure (113) surface orientation with rotational twins, and identified two distinct in-plane relationships between ScN(113) and AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$: the dominant $[1\bar{1}0]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[33\bar{2}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$, and the less prevalent $[\bar{1}\bar{2}1]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[7\bar{4}\bar{1}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$. Broad photoluminescence spectra with a peak emission energy of $\approx 2.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ originated from the lowest direct gap at the $\mathbf{X}$ point, and temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements revealed that impurity band conduction dominates, with electron mobility primarily limited by optical phonon scattering characterized by an effective phonon energy of $(60 \pm 3)\,\mathrm{meV}$.

**27. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: To explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and approaches to optimize its $Z$ sensitivity.
- **Finding**: Ptychography's $Z$-dependence is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column; a monotonic $Z$-dependence is found when reconstructed projected atomic potentials are integrated over a small region, while increasing the integration area leads to highly non-monotonic $Z$-contrast following orbital shell-structure trends. The reconstructed projected potential aligns with the transmission function with an overall deviation of only 2.4%, and this non-monotonic $Z$-dependence is shown to be useful for accentuating contrast between certain elements, allowing for distinguishability of elements only a single atomic number apart, even in samples thicker than 20 nm, as demonstrated for $\beta$-CuZn.

- **Authors**: J. M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
- **Date**: 2025-05-30
- **Objective**: To study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si) formed by self-ion implantation amorphization, particularly focusing on Medium-Range Order (MRO) and structural relaxation upon thermal annealing.
- **Finding**: Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in a-Si that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model.

- **Finding**: Characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), along with X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, were used to analyze the electrocatalysts. The Nb$_{2}$O$_{5}$ doped with 0.5% Ce showed the highest electrocatalytic response, producing 105% and 86% more H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ at applied potentials of -1.3 V and -1.9 V respectively, compared to undoped Nb$_{2}$O$_{5}$. This enhanced performance is attributed to Ce-doping inducing local distortions in the Nb$_{2}$O$_{5}$ crystal lattice due to the ionic radius difference between Nb$^{5+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$, which, combined with increased hydrophilicity and wetting properties, facilitated electron transfer and O$_{2}$ transport, favoring the ORR.
