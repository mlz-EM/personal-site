- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate how substrate morphology can be used to control and reverse the strain state in $V_{2}O_{3}$ thin films, thereby tuning its metal-insulator transition.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that minute changes in sapphire substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped, created by annealing) can reverse the dominant strain in $V_{2}O_{3}$ thin films, from compressive (due to lattice mismatch) to tensile (due to thermal expansion mismatch). This control over strain significantly impacts the metal-insulator transition, leading to either its full suppression or stabilization of insulating phases across all temperatures. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) was employed to image atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in the $V_{2}O_{3}$ film, elucidating the strain relaxation mechanism and highlighting a novel way to tune strain in thin films.

- **Authors**: Nicola Curreli, Tero S. Kulmala, Riya Sebait, Nicolò Petrini, Matteo Bruno Lodi, Roman Furrer, Alessandro Fanti, Michel Calame, Ilka Kriegel
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a contactless method for dynamically controlling the relative orientation (interlayer twist) of layers in 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures using electron-beam-induced charge injection.
- **Finding**: A proof-of-concept demonstration showed that localized charging of an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on a grounded graphene layer using an electron beam creates an interfacial electric field, generating in-plane electrostatic torque that induces angular displacement. In-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to validate the induced rotation, providing direct visual evidence of the manipulation. This contactless actuation method offers a scalable approach for reconfigurable nanoscale devices.

- **Authors**: Chih-Yu Lee, Yi-Siou Huang, Felix Adams, Chuanyu Lian, Hongyi Sun, Jie Zhao, Zichao Ye, Nathan Youngblood, Juejun Hu, Leslie H Allen, Yifei Mo, Ichiro Takeuchi, Carlos A Rios Ocampo
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of Si doping into $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ to tailor the optical properties and phase change characteristics of chalcogenide-based optical phase change materials (OPCMs).
- **Finding**: The study found that 20% Si doping in $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ increased the transparency window in both amorphous and crystalline states (specifically to 800 nm in the amorphous phase) and reduced power consumption by lowering the melting temperature. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) were employed to investigate the crystal structure and morphology of the thin films, complementing ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and nano-differential scanning calorimetry in characterizing the material's properties.

**35. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: To introduce aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) as a method to improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging, especially in the presence of higher-order aberrations.
- **Finding**: The paper demonstrates that aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC) images, enables continuously non-zero contrast transfer within the information limit, even when higher-order aberrations are present. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the probe-forming lens's resultant phase shift acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF contrast transfer function. This method, applied to both simulated and experimental data, shows superior performance compared to tcBF or DPC methods alone, offering improved dose-efficient imaging in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM).

The method includes an adaptive sampling strategy that prioritizes images from domain wall regions, reducing training data requirements while improving accuracy. This approach was successfully demonstrated for domain mapping in ferroelectric boracite, $Cu_{3}B_{7}O_{13}Cl$, providing a powerful and efficient tool for understanding the atomic-scale structural variations that govern macroscopic functionalities in ferroelectric materials.

- **Objective**: To develop an automated deep learning-based framework for precise and efficient segmentation and quantification of lead iodide, perovskite, and defect domains in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite solar cell thin films.
- **Finding**: A deep learning model, PerovSegNet, based on an improved YOLOv8x architecture, was developed for automated SEM image analysis. This framework enables precise and efficient identification of different phases and defect domains, which is critical for understanding crystallization and device performance. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is highlighted as indispensable for characterizing microstructure, and the PerovSegNet model, trained on a large dataset of SEM images, achieves high accuracy (87.25% mAP) while being computationally efficient. It provides quantitative grain-level metrics, establishing itself as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.

- **Authors**: Luize Dipane, Liora Kotlara, Viktors Vibornijs, Katrina Laganovska, Aleksejs Zolotarjovs, Eriks Dipans, Jevgenijs Gabrusenoks, Boris Polyakov, Edgars Butanovs
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the fabrication of ZnSe-MoSe2 and ZnSe-WSe2 core-shell nanowires and to control the morphology of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) shells through temperature optimization during a two-step growth process.
- **Finding**: Core-shell nanowires of ZnSe-MoSe2 and ZnSe-WSe2 were successfully fabricated. The study found that the TMD shell morphology could be controlled by optimizing the selenization process temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was a key characterization technique, alongside X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, to analyze the as-grown nanostructures and understand the different growth mechanisms influencing shell morphology. This work provides insights for growing high-quality core-shell heterostructures for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

- **Authors**: Naisargi Kanabar, Seiichiro Higashiya, Daniele Cherniak, Devendra Sadana, Stephen Bedell, Haralabos Efstathiadis
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Objective**: To examine the lithium distribution and its evolution in anode and cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate cycling, providing insights into lithium loss, trapping, and plating mechanisms.
- **Finding**: Post-mortem analysis of NMC/Graphite coin cells cycled at high C-rates revealed significant changes in lithium distribution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to characterize the morphology and elemental composition of the electrodes, complementing Li nuclear reaction analysis (Li-NRA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). SEM imaging supported XRD findings of lithium depletion and structural deformation in the cathode and showed enhanced peaks in the dead graphite anode, possibly indicating metallic lithium or copper. These techniques collectively highlighted surface lithium accumulation on the anode (likely SEI formation and plating) and a decrease in cathode lithium content, linking these changes to capacity fade and increased internal resistance.

**40. [Electrical resistivity of microstructural components in Al-Mg-Si alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25089v1)**
- **Authors**: Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and microstructure on the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg-Si alloys, specifically by measuring the resistivity of individual microstructural components.
- **Finding**: The study characterized the crystal structure, composition, and microstructure of Al-Mg-Si alloys using X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A microscale four-point probe setup inside an SEM was used to directly measure the electrical resistivity of microstructural components, such as the Al solid solution matrix and Si or $Mg_{2}Si$ precipitates. This direct measurement revealed that the Al solid solution matrix can be up to 15% more resistive than pure Al depending on heat treatment, while regions with precipitates showed similar resistivity.

**41. [Nanoscale Polar Landscapes in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24969v1)**
- **Authors**: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To directly image and characterize the real-space structure of low-temperature polar domains in quantum paraelectric $SrTiO_{3}$.
- **Finding**: Using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) down to 20 K, the study directly imaged the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric $SrTiO_{3}$. High-resolution STEM revealed a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains with finite polarization. These short-range polar domains initially grow and self-organize into a periodic structure, but this process reverses below 40 K in the quantum paraelectric regime, causing the periodically ordered polar nanodomains to fragment into smaller clusters. Cryogenic STEM was essential for directly visualizing these nanoscale polar landscapes and their temperature-dependent evolution, providing unprecedented insight into the structure of this textbook quantum paraelectric.

- **Authors**: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman
- **Date**: 2025-09-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the viability of image reconstruction in position-blind ptychography, where scan positions are unknown and must be recovered jointly with the image, particularly for single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging.
- **Finding**: This work explores the challenging inverse problem of position-blind ptychography, where both the image and the scan positions are unknown. Through simulated 2-D variants, the study demonstrates that reliable and successful image reconstructions can be achieved even with measurement noise, provided there is the right illumination structure and a strong data-driven image prior (score-based diffusion models). While not directly using electron microscopy, this research is highly relevant to advanced imaging techniques like ptychography, which are also applied in electron microscopy for high-resolution phase retrieval, and addresses a fundamental challenge of unknown probe positions that can arise in various scanning probe imaging contexts.

- **Authors**: Shelby S. Fields, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Cory D. Cress, Nicholas G. Combs, Olaf van 't Erve, Patrick G. Callahan, Keith E. Knipling, Michelle E. Jamer, Frank M. Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) behavior observed in $RuO_{2}$/Fe bilayer heterostructures, specifically to determine if it stems from altermagnetic ordering in $RuO_{2}$ or interfacial chemical disorder.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that the exchange bias (EB) behavior in $Ru$-capped $RuO_{2}$/Fe bilayers is not due to altermagnetism in $RuO_{2}$, but rather driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer, specifically $Fe_{3}O_{4}$, which pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperatures. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was a crucial technique used to characterize the interface and confirm the presence of this iron oxide interlayer, providing structural evidence for the proposed mechanism. This finding clarifies that EB alone cannot be considered definitive evidence for altermagnetic ordering in $RuO_{2}$ thin films due to the potential for interfacial chemical disorder.

- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To report on the installation and performance of a new side-entry helium flow cryostat stage for (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopes (S/TEM) designed for imaging and spectroscopy at ultra-low temperatures below 7 K.
- **Finding**: A new side-entry condenZero cryogenic cooling system for JEOL S/TEMs was successfully installed and demonstrated stable operation at a base temperature of 6.58 K with minimal fluctuations. The system's performance was validated through in-situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) via aluminum bulk plasmon analysis, which measured the local specimen temperature. The integration of this cryogenic stage with various electron microscopy techniques, including electron diffraction and Lorentz TEM, was showcased by resolving charge density wave (CDW) transitions in $NbSe_{2}$ using electron diffraction and imaging nanometric magnetic skyrmions in MnSi via Lorentz TEM. This platform provides a reliable, low-drift route for direct visualization of electronic and magnetic phase transformations in quantum materials at ultralow temperatures.

- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten (W) in air and the sublimation of W oxide at elevated temperatures to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
- **Finding**: The oxidation of pure W at temperatures between 400 and 1050°C was studied, revealing the formation of voids and cracks above 600°C, leading to dust formation or oxide spalling, which poses challenges for fusion power plant maintenance. Electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used for characterization, revealing a three-layered oxide scale: an inner $30-50$ nm thick $WO_{2}$ layer, a middle $10-20$ $\mu$m thick $WO_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer layer of $WO_{2.9}/WO_{3}$ phases. Electron microscopy was crucial for visualizing the microstructure of these oxide layers and preferential oxidation at specimen edges, providing insights into the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and potential implications for tritium permeation.

**46. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that can overcome the challenges posed by speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging systems.
- **Finding**: The study first demonstrates that speckle noise fundamentally limits SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes when sequential measurements are subject to independent speckle. To overcome this, a novel snapshot SA imaging method and an aperture-phase-synchronization strategy were developed. Remarkably, simulations showed that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, thereby improving resolution. While this paper focuses on light-based imaging, the principles of synthetic aperture and managing noise are broadly relevant to advanced imaging, including potential future developments in electron microscopy where coherence and phase retrieval are critical.

- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the low-temperature MOCVD synthesis of 2D indium selenide (InSe) on c-plane sapphire substrates to achieve phase-pure, high-mobility material for future logic and optoelectronic devices.
- **Finding**: A systematic investigation of InSe synthesis via MOCVD at low temperatures on c-plane sapphire substrates successfully identified conditions for the formation of 2D InSe. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were crucial in characterizing the morphology, composition, and crystal structure. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional STEM specifically revealed an epitaxial alignment of InSe with the sapphire substrate, mediated by a specific interface reconstruction. The optimized MOCVD-grown InSe exhibited strong optical absorption and comparably high electron mobility, demonstrating its potential for applications.

**48. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties of $UTe_{2}$ at ambient conditions.
- **Finding**: The study used single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements to investigate the structural properties of $UTe_{2}$. While SC-XRD confirmed highly ordered crystalline lattices with the expected $Immm$ structure and no uranium vacancies, STEM revealed tiny amounts of interstitial defects on the $Te_{2}$ layers that host Te chains along the b axis. These interstitial defects, though small, are argued to cause the slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are sufficient to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state, explaining the observed sample-to-sample variation. STEM's ability to visualize these nanoscale defects was critical in identifying the structural disorder responsible for the variability.

- **Objective**: To provide an introduction and overview of the instrumentation and capabilities of the SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) for soft X-ray ptychography experiments.
- **Finding**: The SOPHIE endstation at SLS is presented as a key synchrotron microscopy technique for soft X-ray ptychography, offering high spatial resolution and strong contrast mechanisms for condensed matter physics, chemistry, and life sciences. The instrumentation overview includes an example demonstrating the achievement of sub-5 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV. While focusing on X-ray ptychography, the principles and high-resolution capabilities are analogous to advanced electron microscopy techniques, emphasizing phase retrieval and high-resolution imaging.

- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate and optimize imaging strategies for both stained and unstained 3D DNA origami nanostructures using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: The study systematically evaluated various imaging strategies for 3D DNA origami nanostructures deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. It found that scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), particularly using the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at a camera length of 600 mm, consistently delivered the highest contrast for both stained and unstained samples. The contrast was further enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate and palladium, which also helped preserve structural integrity. These findings establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions to achieve reliable structural visualization in a transmission electron microscope.
