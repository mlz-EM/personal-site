**27. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that overcomes the limitations of speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging and exploits speckle to improve resolution.

A snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy were then developed to overcome this limitation. Remarkably, simulations further showed that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, effectively using speckle to improve resolution.

Atomically-resolved cross-sectional STEM also revealed an epitaxial alignment of the InSe with the sapphire substrate, mediated by a specific interface reconstruction, which was verified by in-plane X-ray diffraction. Samples grown under optimized conditions exhibited strong optical absorption in the visible range and comparably high electron mobility, highlighting the potential of MOCVD-grown material for future applications.

**29. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of the large sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_2$ at ambient conditions.
- **Finding**: Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices, consistent with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. The authors argue that these defects give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are sufficient to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_2$, highlighting the necessity for future order parameter determination efforts to focus on single crystals with minimal structural disorder.

**31. [Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17801v1)**
- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained 3D DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids to find optimal imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) consistently delivered the highest contrast for DNA origami, with optimal performance achieved using a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at a camera length of 600 mm. As expected, contrast was higher for thicker three-dimensional nanotubes compared to DNA 6-helix bundles due to larger projected thickness. Heavy metal staining with uranyl formate effectively enhanced contrast, and 3D molds preserved their dimensions and largely retained structural integrity upon staining or complexation with palladium, which also improved visibility.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To directly measure the ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles and capture their phase-space correlations, particularly focusing on their velocities.
- **Finding**: The study directly measured the ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles, revealing that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities before annihilation, with measurements indicating velocities exceeding the speed of light. These superluminal velocities were paradoxically amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes. These phenomena were demonstrated using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions each an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, enabling unprecedented probing of topological defect dynamics and suggesting ultrafast information flow in polaritonic media.

- **Authors**: Jisheng Xie, Zhiheng Xie, Dijin Jiang, Shiyun Li, Yiheng Dai, Yao Zhang, Mufan Li, Jihan Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To develop a method for precisely tracking the three-dimensional (3D) atomic structural evolution of individual bimetallic nanocatalysts during electrocatalytic reactions.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, a method for directly tracking 3D atomic rearrangements in identical nanoparticles during electrocatalytic reactions. Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles as a model system, they captured the atomic evolution of single nanocatalysts throughout electrocatalytic cycles, observing two stages: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, which were corroborated with voltage-dependent behaviors probed by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. The study identified chemical short-range order at the atomic level and revealed anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations, highlighting the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into the rational design of functional nanocatalysts.

- **Authors**: Ernst Artes, Primiana Cavallo, Tobias Häger, Carl-Christian Meyer, Christoph Mokry, Dennis Renisch, Jörg Runke, Evgenia Schaffner, Alice Seibert, Christina Trautmann, Christoph E. Düllmann
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Objective**: To elucidate the possible influence of water and carbon dioxide present in the plating solution on the quality of terbium and thulium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: Terbium and thulium thin films were produced under controlled conditions, and their morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that water in the plating solution negatively affects the quality of thin films when its concentration exceeds 1 vol.-%. Chemical analysis using infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the formation of hydroxides, oxides, and carbonates, with the presence of CO$_2$ leading to an increased carbonate content that also negatively influenced film quality. Deposition yields were determined by neutron activation analysis.

- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To observe and understand size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes, a phenomenon rarely reported for correlated electronic states.
- **Finding**: Using 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes as a prototypical 2D CDW system, in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperatures down to 20 K revealed a melting point depression of CDW for flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, a zero-temperature correlation length of 10-50 nm was estimated, matching reported CDW domain sizes. As the flake size approaches the correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition is cut off, limiting long-range order and lowering the transition temperature. For very small flakes whose size is close to the correlation length, the absence of CDWs was also observed, as predicted by the model, demonstrating that an electronic phase transition can follow classical nucleation theory.

**36. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To develop corrections for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging to accurately estimate the true surface pore size and porosity in nanoporous membranes, accounting for systematic underestimations caused by high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that imaging a commercial ultrafiltration (UF) membrane at 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (at 1 kV) to 6.3%, while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane and 46% for an RO support. To account for coating thickness, a digital correction method was developed that simulates pore dilation, enabling the estimation of pore structure for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support (about 3-fold greater than coated values), and mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for UF and 1.5-fold greater for RO support. Critically, these dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data, suggesting that true surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood.

- **Authors**: Kousuke Ooe, Yufan Shen, Kazuki Shitara, Shunsuke Kobayashi, Yuichi Shimakawa, Daisuke Kan, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To directly observe the atomic-scale dynamics of polarization switching in fluorite ferroelectrics (ZrO$_2$ and Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$) to gain a deeper understanding of their unique ferroelectric mechanism.
- **Finding**: The researchers directly observed polarization switching pathways by visualizing oxygen site dynamics in freestanding ZrO$_2$ and Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ membranes using optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), an advanced atomic-column imaging technique. They found that 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, the study also revealed how different cation species in fluorite oxides impact the accessible polarization switching pathways, providing atomic-level insights into polarization switching dynamics that can inform the advanced engineering of these materials for memory devices.

- **Date**: 2025-09-18
- **Objective**: To investigate coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope, aiming to adapt quantum-enhanced imaging techniques to electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated ghost imaging of complex patterns using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope, utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup. They achieved a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m. This work paves the way for adapting quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy, exploiting correlations between electrons and photons where the particle relaying spatial information remains non-interacting, and the probing particle is not spatially resolved.

- **Authors**: Hao Li, Zhongxia Shang, Michael P. Lilly, Maksym Myronov, Leonid P. Rokhinson
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To conduct a comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ir germanides and germanosilicide films formed by solid-phase epitaxy, with an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films.
- **Finding**: For films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, the study reported critical temperatures ($T_c$) of 3.4 K for IrGe and 2.6 K for IrSiGe, which are significant for superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface, providing crucial structural insights into these superconducting materials.

Dunin-Borkowski, Michael Farle, Bai-Xiang Xu, Leopoldo Molina-Luna, Oliver Gutfleisch, Baptiste Gault, Konstantin Skokov
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanism of substantial coercivity in Ce(Co$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_5$ permanent magnets by identifying and characterizing nanoscale pinning centers.
- **Finding**: Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), the study identified a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition in Ce(Co$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)$_{5.4}$ magnets. This structure consisted of Cu-poor cylindrical cells (~5-10 nm in diameter, ~20 nm long) with a disordered CeCo$_5$-type structure and Cu-rich cell boundaries (~5 nm thick) with a modified CeCo$_5$ structure. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that intrinsic Cu concentration gradients (up to 12 at.% Cu/nm) led to spatial variations in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity. This identification of nanoscale chemical segregation provides a microstructural basis for the long-standing phenomenon of "giant intrinsic magnetic hardness" in such systems, offering avenues for designing rare-earth-lean permanent magnets.

- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To understand the underlying degradation mechanisms and improve the operational lifetimes of heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs).
- **Finding**: The study observed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer (ETL), QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer of InP/ZnSe/ZnS (red-emitting) and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS (blue-emitting) cadmium-free QD-LEDs during operation. This was accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals throughout the device, with oxygen accumulating at the electrode/ETL interface. In situ transmission electron microscopy revealed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. Acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment was shown to stabilize the ETL/QD layers by suppressing radical formation and halting morphology changes, achieving dramatic lifetime enhancements (8-fold and 5000-fold for red- and blue-emitting QD-LEDs, respectively).

**42. [Coupled Infrared Imaging and Multiphysics Modeling to Predict Three-Dimensional Thermal Characteristics during Selective Laser Melting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12545v1)**
- **Authors**: Vijay Kumar, Kaitlyn M. Mullin, Hyunggon Park, Matthew Gerigk, Andrew Bresk, Tresa M. Pollock, Yangying Zhu
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To develop an integrated experimental-computational approach that couples high-speed infrared imaging with multiphysics modeling to accurately resolve and predict three-dimensional (3D) thermal characteristics during selective laser melting (SLM).
- **Finding**: The researchers demonstrated a unique approach coupling high-speed infrared imaging during selective laser melting of MAR-M247 with a transient 3D multiphysics simulation to reconstruct the dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool. This integrated framework enabled the estimation of experimentally-validated 3D solidification conditions—including solidification velocities and cooling rates—at the solid-liquid interface while significantly lowering computational cost. Variations in microstructure size and orientation driven by laser processing parameters were predicted and validated with ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps, substantiating that an integrated experimental-computational approach is crucial for in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in commercial additive manufacturing.

**43. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v2)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron ptychography phase imaging using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The study applied the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance. It found that for a weak-phase object, ptychography cannot reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but is more robust to partial coherence. This work addresses the question of whether ptychography or HRTEM provides a more fluence-efficient imaging technique for beam-sensitive materials, especially under cryo conditions, where electron ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has shown promise for reconstructing low-noise phase data at reduced fluence.

**44. [Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO$_2$(100) Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11568v1)**
- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To understand and control the atomic structure of the polar CeO$_2$(100) surface to unravel its surface reactivity and design advanced catalytic materials.
- **Finding**: The researchers discovered a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO$_2$(100) surface through an integrated approach combining global structure search algorithms, machine learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This reconstructed surface, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms, was found to be both thermodynamically and kinetically stable. Importantly, the formation of localized Ce$^{3+}$ polarons introduced occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H$_2$O, revealing a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism for tuning catalytic performance.

**45. [MatQnA: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Materials Characterization and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11335v1)**
- **Authors**: Yonghao Weng, Liqiang Gao, Linwu Zhu, Jian Huang
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To introduce MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed to systematically validate the capabilities of AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), in the specialized field of materials characterization and analysis.
- **Finding**: The study presented MatQnA, a benchmark dataset encompassing ten mainstream materials characterization methods, including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Employing a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation, high-quality question-answer pairs (both multiple-choice and subjective) were constructed. Preliminary evaluations showed that advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao Vision Pro 32K) achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in this field.

**46. [Intrinsic Quantum Clusters in Kagome Weyl Semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11230v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuqing Xing, Hui Chen, Li Huang, Roger Guzman, Qi Zheng, Senhao Lv, Jinan Shi, Haitao Yang, Wu Zhou, Hong-Jun Gao
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping the quantum states of the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, a kagome lattice system.
- **Finding**: The researchers uncovered intrinsic quantum clusters—localized intrinsic point defects identified as native oxygen defects—on the surface of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM/EELS). On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities occupying hollow sites between three Sn atoms tuned the flat band near the Fermi level, exhibiting an orbital magnetism-induced unconventional Zeeman effect under an applied magnetic field. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials generated occupied impurity states that retained sixfold symmetry at higher energies but reduced to C2 symmetry at lower energies, showing no measurable magnetic response. These findings establish intrinsic oxygen-related quantum clusters as tunable local perturbations in a topological kagome magnet, offering a versatile platform to probe and engineer impurity-driven phenomena.

- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam scanning trajectories on dose efficiency and artifact suppression in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography.
- **Finding**: The study systematically benchmarked the impact of non-raster trajectories, including spiral and multi-pass sequential patterns, on dose-sensitive EELS and ptychography using DyScO$_3$ as a model perovskite. Ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position. In contrast, atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Finally, spiral scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO$_3$ thin films improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions. These results establish practical guidelines for implementing programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM and highlight the inherent resilience of ptychography to trajectory-induced artifacts.

- **Authors**: Debarghya Mallick, Sujoy Ghosh, An Hsi Chen, Qiangsheng Lu, Liam Collins, Sangsoo Kim, Gyula Eres, Ivan Kravchenko, Stephen Jesse, Steven J. Randolph, Scott T. Retterer, Matthew Brahlek, Robert G. Moore
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the fabrication of all-in-plane superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak link junctions by "nanosculpting" channels in FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ (FTS/BT) thin films using focused Si$^{++}$ ion beams, and to investigate their superconducting properties and implications for vortex pinning.
- **Finding**: The researchers demonstrated the nanosculpting of ~100 nm-wide channels into FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films using a Si$^{++}$ focused ion beam (FIB), creating controllable weak links. Systematic irradiation showed that increasing the ion dose progressively suppressed both the critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$). Kelvin probe force microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) corroborated the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region. $I_c(B)$ measurements revealed a slower field-induced decay of $I_c$ at higher doses, indicating that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers. By tuning beam energy and dose, the process shifted from an SC-N-SC regime toward a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SC-I-SC) geometry, offering a simple scalable pathway to Josephson junction fabrication.

- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and understand the mechanisms behind gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconducting field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ FeS-FETs. Combining high-resolution electron microscopy with electrical transport measurements, the NDR was attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance alpha-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging revealed that in-plane electric fields ($V_d$) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments generating Moire patterns, and intralayer shear, collectively producing stress-induced phase transitions. In contrast, out-of-plane fields resulted in robust non-volatile polarization switching. These mechanistic insights highlight both the promise of 2D ferroelectric devices for multifunctional nanoelectronics and alternative computing paradigms, and the intrinsic limitations of In$_2$Se$_3$ field-effect transistors for conventional ferroelectric memory applications.

- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: To employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS$_2$) nanoparticles and explain recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations.
- **Finding**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations revealed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes as the nanoparticle edges were approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained these experimental observations by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need for full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. The study also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials using limited Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, effectively capturing both covalent and van der Waals interactions for accurate extrapolations to larger systems.
