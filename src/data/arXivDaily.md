In-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) was used to monitor the growth dynamics, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provided insights into the morphology of the grown films. The combination of these techniques, along with Raman spectroscopy, allowed the identification of layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide GaSe with an unstrained in-plane lattice constant of $0.371 \pm 0.001$ nm and partial epitaxial alignment. SEM was key for visualizing the surface morphology across different growth conditions.

- **Authors**: Damian Brzozowski, Yu Liu, Karola Neeleman, Magnus Nord, Ingrid G. Hallsteinsen
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Objective**: Control the growth of highly textured Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films on (111) SrTiO$_3$ substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to optimize their structural and electronic properties.
- **Finding**: Highly textured Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films were successfully grown, with stoichiometry controllable by growth temperature and pressure. Tuning laser pulsing frequency and fluence led to significant changes in surface roughness, porosity, grain boundaries, and grain shape, with grain sizes reaching up to 430 nm. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were crucial, revealing a sharp, atomically clean substrate-film interface without atomic intermixing or amorphous intermediate layers, confirming the high crystalline quality comparable to molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown films. This demonstrates PLD as a viable method for integrating high-quality chalcogenides with perovskites.

- **Authors**: Konstantin Lion, Piero Mazzolini, Kingsley Egbo, Toni Markurt, Oliver Bierwagen, Martin Albrecht, Claudia Draxl
- **Date**: 2025-10-10
- **Objective**: Investigate the surface reconstructions of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) using a combination of first-principles calculations and experimental observations.
- **Finding**: The study identified several stable surface reconstructions for $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001), including a novel 1$\times$2 reconstruction composed of paired GaO$_4$ tetrahedra, which exhibits remarkable stability across a wide range of growth conditions. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging of homoepitaxially grown (001) layers provided experimental evidence consistent with the predicted 1$\times$2 structure, showing two Ga atoms sharing an oxygen bond and separated by a distance of $2.64$ Å. This experimental validation from STEM imaging was critical for confirming the theoretical predictions and understanding surface properties during epitaxial growth.

- **Date**: 2025-10-09
- **Objective**: Explore higher-order epitaxy as a method to control material properties and induce emergent phenomena, specifically focusing on suppressing structural instability and inducing superconductivity in FeTe films.
- **Finding**: Single-crystalline FeTe films grown on CdTe(001) substrates via 6:5 commensurate higher-order epitaxy exhibited suppressed tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural transition and emergent substrate-selective two-dimensional superconductivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was instrumental in revealing self-organized periodic interstitials near the interface, which arose from the higher-order lattice matching. These observations from STEM directly demonstrated how the unique interfacial structure, driven by higher-order epitaxy, leads to the suppression of structural distortion and the emergence of superconductivity.

- **Date**: 2025-10-08
- **Objective**: Achieve accurate control and compensation of magnetic anisotropy in ultrathin bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) films grown by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering.
- **Finding**: Epitaxially grown nm-thick BiYIG films showed accurate control of magnetic properties through sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain. Films with up to -0.80% lattice mismatch remained fully strained up to 60 nm thick, maintaining high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed coherent epitaxial growth, absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. These electron microscopy techniques were critical for verifying the structural integrity and chemical composition of the ultrathin films, which enabled the precise tuning of magnetic anisotropy via magneto-elastic coupling and cation stoichiometry, leading to low-damping films suitable for spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices.

- **Finding**: High-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase TiO$_2$ films, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, exhibited record-high electron mobility, closely matching predictions from a first-principles electron-phonon diagrammatic Monte Carlo (FEP-DMC) framework. Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in modulating transport at lower temperatures. STEM provided direct structural information about the film quality and defects, which was essential for validating the theoretical models and understanding the origin of the observed transport properties, establishing a predictive theory-experiment workflow for polarons in complex oxides.

This framework supports multiple incidence and rotation angles and flexible experimental geometries, allowing reconstructions from random guesses without strong structural priors. While focused on X-ray imaging, the principles of advanced reconstruction for nanoscale structures are analogous to those used in electron tomography and other 3D electron microscopy techniques for recovering complex buried features.

- **Finding**: Neel-type skyrmions were observed in thin layers of Co-Al and Co-Ni-Al alloys over a wide temperature range up to 770 K, achieved by imposing a vertical strain gradient via epitaxy with an Ir-Al underlayer. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (Lorentz TEM) was directly used to observe these Neel skyrmions in freestanding membranes at high temperatures, providing crucial real-space evidence of their existence and stability. This direct observation by Lorentz TEM at elevated temperatures is a key contribution, demonstrating a pathway to hot skyrmions in simple centrosymmetric ferromagnets for technological applications.

- **Date**: 2025-10-06
- **Objective**: Provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in the theory and instrumentation of time-resolved and ultrafast electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) for imaging nanoscale carrier, thermal, and structural dynamics.
- **Finding**: Time-resolved and ultrafast EELS, performed in specialized scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) or ultrafast electron microscopes (UEM), is an emerging technique capable of directly imaging photoexcited carriers, lattice dynamics, and near-fields across femtosecond to microsecond timescales. The review highlights how these advanced electron microscopy techniques, combined with theoretical calculations and electron optics, can measure and interpret ground-state and transient EEL spectra, spanning low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations. It emphasizes the ability of EELS to uncover nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum materials and solar energy conversion devices, positioning it as a critical tool due to ongoing advancements in electron beam monochromation, in situ cells, and high-speed direct electron detectors.

- **Authors**: Alexander Blackston, Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Sevim Polat Genlik, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Roberto C. Myers
- **Date**: 2025-10-06
- **Objective**: Experimentally test predictions of 1D dispersive electronic bands confined to dislocation cores in ZnS by correlating sub-bandgap optical transitions with dislocation density.
- **Finding**: The study provides strong evidence for the existence of efficient, 1D band-to-band radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core states in ZnS. Scanning electron microscopy-based electron channeling contrast imaging (SEM-ECCI) was used to quantify the densities of four predicted partial dislocations formed during strain relaxation in epitaxial ZnS grown on GaP. This quantitative correlation between dislocation density measured by SEM-ECCI and sub-bandgap absorption/emission peaks observed in ellipsometry and photoluminescence spectroscopy supports the theoretical predictions of 1D electronic bands at dislocation cores, distinguishing them from typical non-radiative deep-level defects.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: Identify and characterize a novel phase of indium selenide (InSe) that exhibits room temperature ferroelectricity and broken inversion symmetry.
- **Finding**: The researchers discovered a unique $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide in synthesized large-area films, characterized by a zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis was crucial for identifying this novel phase and its unique quintuple layer structure. Cross-sectional STEM further revealed intralayer shifting within the $\beta^\text{p}$ layers. The STEM observations, combined with electric-field-induced switchable polarization and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses, confirmed the breaking of inversion symmetry and the presence of ferroelectricity at room temperature in this low-dimensional van der Waals material.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: Investigate the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components.
- **Finding**: The study reports the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules (7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene) on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements were critical, revealing spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure TO[11]H monolayers, which indicated the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. This direct observation by SP-LEEM, supported by density functional theory calculations, demonstrated that strong chemisorption induces hybridization between molecular and copper states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface and thus inducing magnetism.

**43. [Observation of a Novel CDW Superstructure in Monolayer 1T-VS$_2$ at Room Temperature and its Evolution in Multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03800v1)**
- **Authors**: Samanta Pal, Kaustuv Chatterjee, A. K. Raychaudhuri, Prabir Pal
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: Investigate the spontaneous formation and evolution of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayer and multilayer 1T-VS$_2$ at room temperature.
- **Finding**: A novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1$^\circ$ was discovered in monolayer 1T-VS$_2$ at room temperature. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) were essential for observing the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases and, crucially, for directly visualizing and identifying this novel CDW superstructure in the 1T phase. HRTEM and ED further revealed that the CDW order evolves to a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure with increasing layer thickness, which was attributed to vanadium self-intercalation as V$^{3+}$ ions in multilayer VS$_2$. These electron microscopy techniques provided direct real-space and reciprocal-space evidence for the CDW formations and their evolution.

**44. [In-situ characterisation and data-driven crystal plasticity analysis of short-to-long crack transition in a ductile aluminium alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03713v1)**
- **Authors**: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: Conduct an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation in a ductile aluminum alloy to understand the transition from microstructure-sensitive short cracks to load-controlled long cracks.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that the short-to-long crack transition in cold-worked 5052 aluminum alloy is process-zone governed, rather than length-scale governed. In-situ scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC) provided high-resolution displacement fields, while electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) characterized the microstructure. SEM-DIC allowed for the extraction of local (elastic) mode I and II stress intensity factors (SIFs) and energy release rates, correlating them with crack interaction with microstructural features. The combination of SEM-DIC and EBSD was critical for directly observing and quantifying the crack growth behavior and its interaction with the microstructure, showing a quasi-brittle growth at low energy release rates followed by plasticity-dominated crack arrest at a critical energy release rate.

- **Finding**: The researchers successfully grew up to 180 nm thick (111)-oriented FeO heteroepitaxial films on 4H-SiC(0001), despite FeO's thermodynamic instability at ambient conditions. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), collectively confirmed the epilayer as phase-pure wüstite FeO with atomically sharp FeO/SiC interfaces. S/TEM provided direct atomic-scale imaging of the interface and crystal structure, while EDS and EELS were crucial for elemental and chemical state analysis, verifying the successful epitaxial stabilization of FeO and its high crystalline quality.

**47. [Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02234v2)**
- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: Investigate how substrate morphology can be used to control and reverse the strain state in V$_2$O$_3$ thin films, thereby tuning its metal-insulator transition.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that minute changes in substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped sapphire) can reverse the strain state in V$_2$O$_3$ films, shifting it from compressive to tensile by allowing thermal expansion mismatch to dominate over lattice mismatch. This control over strain significantly impacts the metal-insulator transition, leading to either its suppression or stabilization of insulating phases across all temperatures. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) was employed to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V$_2$O$_3$ film, providing direct atomic-scale evidence of the strain relaxation mechanism and the film's structural response to substrate morphology.

- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: Demonstrate a contactless method for manipulating the interlayer twist angle in 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures using electron-beam-induced charge injection.
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully demonstrated contactless electrostatic actuation to induce angular displacement (twist) in vdW heterostructures, specifically a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on graphene. This was achieved by locally charging the insulating hBN with an electron beam, creating an interfacial electric field that generates in-plane electrostatic torque. In-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to validate the induced rotation by directly observing the angular displacement of the hBN flake relative to the graphene layer. This method offers a new, scalable approach for reconfiguring nanoscale devices.

- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: Investigate the effects of Si doping on the optical properties, crystal structure, and phase change characteristics of Sb$_2$Se$_3$ to tailor it as an optical phase change material (OPCM).
- **Finding**: Incorporating 20% Si into Sb$_2$Se$_3$ thin films significantly increased the transparency window in both amorphous and crystalline states, extending it to 800 nm ($1.55$ eV) in the amorphous phase, and reduced power consumption by lowering the melting temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the morphology and crystal structure of the Si-doped films. These electron microscopy techniques, alongside X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, provided crucial structural insights into the nanocomposites, helping to understand how Si doping influences the material's phase change behavior and optical properties, despite a trade-off in refractive index contrast and phase transition kinetics.

**50. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: Develop a method to improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging by leveraging higher-order aberrations, specifically for aberration-corrected bright-field (acBF) imaging.
- **Finding**: The researchers demonstrated that aberration-corrected bright-field (acBF) imaging, which combines tilt-corrected bright-field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC), enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. In a spherically-aberration-limited system at Scherzer defocus, the probe-forming lens's resultant phase shift acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF contrast transfer function (CTF). This method, validated on both simulated and experimental 4D-STEM data, produces superior performance compared to tcBF or DPC methods alone, significantly enhancing dose-efficient imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy by improving contrast transfer and information recovery.
