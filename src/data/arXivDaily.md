- **Objective**: To investigate superconductivity and establish the phase diagram of Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy.
- **Finding**: The study revealed an asymmetric dome-like superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) profile with optimal $T_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 42$ K at $x=0.09$, persisting across a wide doping range. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) showed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar NiO$_2$ sites in thin films, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk, and observed elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, which likely weaken interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling and contribute to reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. STEM was critical for revealing the unique structural characteristics and vacancy distribution in the thin films.

- **Authors**: Jongwoo Ha, Minah Choi, Jieun Yang, Chinkyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-05-16
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a scalable thru-hole epitaxy (THE) method for localized, defect-suppressed GaN growth using self-adjusting hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) masks prepared via a solution-processed 2D stack.
