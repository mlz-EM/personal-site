- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a mechanism for tuning the strain state in V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ Mott insulator thin films by controlling the substrate morphology, thereby influencing its metal-insulator transition.
