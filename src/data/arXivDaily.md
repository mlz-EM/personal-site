- **Authors**: Samantha E. Smith, Santiago Bermudez, Pavan Chaitanya, Zoe Boekelheide, Jessika Rojas Marin, Ravi L. Hadimani
- **Date**: 2025-05-30
- **Objective**: To examine the impact of high-dose X-ray irradiation on the magnetic and structural properties of gadolinium silicide ($Gd_5Si_4$) nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia treatment.
- **Finding**: The study found that while X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed no structural or compositional changes in $Gd_5Si_4$ nanoparticles after X-ray irradiation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed localized lattice distortions. These distortions correlated with observable changes in magnetic properties, although magnetocaloric properties and specific loss power (SLP) remained unaffected. TEM was crucial for identifying subtle structural changes not detectable by other methods.

**10. [Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176v1)**
- **Authors**: J. M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
- **Date**: 2025-05-30
- **Objective**: To study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si) formed by self-ion implantation amorphization, particularly focusing on Medium-Range Order (MRO).
- **Finding**: Using Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM), the study observed that the degree of Medium-Range Order (MRO) in amorphous silicon (a-Si) first increases, then decreases, and finally recrystallizes upon thermal annealing. FEM revealed that the structure after $500^\circ C$ annealing represents a metastable and highly-ordered paracrystalline (PC) model, independent of initial implantation conditions, and provided insights into defect annealing and the evolution towards a continuous random network before crystallization. FEM was essential for characterizing the MRO in a-Si.

This method, which requires no hardware modification, enables the use of arbitrary beam tilt patterns and allows access to additional information, such as virtual large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (vLACBED) patterns, to assess MRSTEM data quality and improve field measurements. This enhanced 4D-STEM methodology is crucial for higher precision field mapping.

- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: To explore the phase diagram of heterovalent doping in Sr-doped $La_{3-x}Sr_{x}Ni_2O_7$ thin films and investigate their superconducting properties.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar $NiO_2$ sites, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples, due to Coulomb repulsion under compressive strain. STEM also showed elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, suggesting weakened interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, which contributes to the reduced $T_c$ in strained films. STEM was crucial for understanding the atomic-scale structural changes and vacancy distribution.

These strategies were validated through SSB reconstructions of both simulated and experimental 4D-**STEM** datasets of monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_{2}$), demonstrating significant improvements in Poisson noise tolerance and making aberration correction more robust and reliable for low-dose imaging.

-   **Objective**: To comprehensively study rubrene ($C_{48}H_{24}$) thin crystals, focusing on orthorhombic crystalline morphologies, using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopy to understand photoemission processes, crystal morphology, and defect states.
-   **Finding**: In a 2-photon photoemission process (2PPE), the **photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM)** images revealed dominant emission localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states. In contrast, in 1PPE nm excitation, uniform emission across the crystal surface was observed, highlighting a fundamental difference in photoemission mechanisms.
