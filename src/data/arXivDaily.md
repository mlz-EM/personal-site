**2. [Thermal and Size Effects in Ferroelastic Domains by Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10629v1)**
- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between temperature and thickness dependency on ferroelastic domain wall (DW) behavior in free-standing LaAlO$_3$ thin films, particularly across the monopolar-to-dipolar crossover regime.
- **Finding**: A distinct interplay was identified: DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) are mobile near $T_C$ (approximately $550,^\circ$C) and freeze upon cooling, whereas DWs in the crossover regime (200-300 nm) are nearly static. **In situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**, combined with machine-learning-driven image analysis, enabled the precise tracking of DW curvature and density across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes.

- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the magnetic and transport properties of Zn-doped Mn$_2$Sb ferrimagnet and determine if observed Hall-resistivity anomalies are due to chiral spin textures (Topological Hall Effect).

- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To manipulate and observe the spatial evolution of helical domain reorientation under uniaxial tensile stress using *in situ* techniques, focusing on the role of magnetic topological defects.
- **Finding**: The critical stress required for propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) reorientation depends on its angle with the stress direction, analogous to plastic deformation in metals. **In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** allowed for the direct observation that magnetic defects mediate this reorientation via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes, advancing the understanding of strain-driven control in magnetic nanophases.

**18. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03

- **Date**: 2025-11-19
- **Objective**: To develop an atomically dispersed nickel-nitrogen-carbon ($\text{Ni-NC}$) catalyst on carbon nanotubes ($\text{Ni-NCNT}$) and integrate it into a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) for stable and efficient $\text{CO}_{2}$ reduction to CO.
- **Finding**: The $\text{Ni-NCNT}$ electrode achieved a high partial current density of $558~\text{mA}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ toward CO and demonstrated stable operation for over 210 hours. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography was used to generate 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers. COMSOL simulations based on these 3D images demonstrated that the superior performance of $\text{Ni-NCNT}$ is due to improved $\text{CO}_{2}$ diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution compared to carbon black supports.

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the anomalous Nernst and Hall effects in $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_{x}\text{N}$ thin films and correlate them with structural anisotropy.
- **Finding**: Tetragonal samples ($x=0.8$ and 1) display unusual two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst hysteresis loops, resulting from the co-existence of two crystallographic orientations (a-axis and c-axis normal to the film) and opposite signs of the anomalous effects along these directions. Electron microscopy was used, alongside XRD and Mössbauer experiments, to confirm the structural phases and the realization of a small tetragonal distortion for $x>0.35$.

- **Authors**: Anand Ithepalli, Saumya Vashishtha, Naomi Pieczulewski, Qiao Liu, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Matthew Barone, Darrell Schlom, David A. Muller, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Objective**: To investigate how the substrate miscut angle of c-plane sapphire influences the structural quality and superconducting properties of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown $\text{NbN}$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle from $0.5^\text{o}$ to $10^\text{o}$ significantly improves the structural quality of the $\text{NbN}$ films, reducing the rocking curve FWHM from 76 arcsecs to 20 arcsecs, and marginally increasing the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{c}$). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images revealed a critical thickness of approximately $10~\text{nm}$ for the onset of columnar growth, which was found to be independent of the substrate miscut angle.
