- **Finding**: The microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes was investigated using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) during electrochemical cycling. Cryo-STEM revealed that after the first lithiation, the electrode showed a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li$_{15}$Si$_{4}$, various amorphous Li$_{x}$Si phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features. By the 10th delithiation, STEM showed a more uniform microstructure with thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries, demonstrating that a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles from a crystalline starting phase.
