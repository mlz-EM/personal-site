- **Authors**: Wenhui Xu, Shoucong Ning, Pengju Sheng, Huixiang Lin, Angus I Kirkland, Yong Peng, Fucai Zhang
- **Date**: 2024-06-09

Furthermore, the use of loose supports in the algorithm relaxes the stringent requirement for precise knowledge of the scanning illumination's size and position, a necessity in traditional ptychography.

**47. [$\textit{ab initio}$ description of bonding for transmission electron microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07145v3)**
- **Authors**: Jacob Madsen, Timothy J. Pennycook, Toma Susi
- **Date**: 2020-10-14
- **Objective**: To review the motivation and basis for using $\textit{ab initio}$ methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), to generate electrostatic potentials for accurate simulation of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning TEM (STEM) data, moving beyond the independent atom model.
- **Finding**: While the independent atom model is fast, $\textit{ab initio}$ descriptions of the scattering potential are increasingly necessary for advanced techniques like 4D-STEM ptychography, as they account for valence bonding effects previously neglected. Using DFT-derived potentials provides a physically better justified description, enabling the extraction of maximum information from high-resolution electron microscopy data.
