**31. [Unifying Strain-driven and Pressure-driven Superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: Suppressed charge/spin density waves and enhanced interlayer coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12733v1)**
- **Authors**: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: To elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ using density functional theory calculations, by comprehensively analyzing structural, electronic, magnetic, and density wave characteristics.
- **Finding**: Consistent with recent scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations, the study found an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at $-0.9\%$ strain, preceding superconductivity onset. Compressive strain and interfacial Sr diffusion suppress charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities, analogous to pressure effects, and enhance the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling ($J_\perp$), which closely tracks experimental superconducting $T_c$ variation. These findings, supported by experimental observations, suggest that suppressed density waves and enhanced $J_\perp$ are crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity.

**32. [Superconductivity and phase diagram in Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12603v1)**
- **Authors**: Bo Hao, Maosen Wang, Wenjie Sun, Yang Yang, Zhangwen Mao, Shengjun Yan, Haoying Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Lu Han, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dianxiang Ji, Yuefeng Nie
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: To report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing, and to establish their phase diagram.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity was observed across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$), with an optimal $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$42 K at $x = 0.09$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar NiO$_2$ sites in these strained films, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples, due to Coulomb repulsion under compressive strain. Additionally, elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds (exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$) likely weaken interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films and unveiling a unique phase diagram topology for heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping.

- **Date**: 2025-05-16
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a scalable thru-hole epitaxy (THE) method for localized, defect-suppressed GaN growth using self-adjusting hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) masks prepared via solution-processed 2D stacks.
- **Finding**: The disordered $h$-BN mask, formed by spin-coating, self-adjusts during growth to allow percolative precursor transport and coherent GaN nucleation beneath otherwise blocking layers. Comprehensive structural analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the presence of epitaxial GaN beneath the $h$-BN and significant suppression of threading dislocations, demonstrating a scalable route for selective-area GaN growth without the need for patterned 2D mask transfers.

- **Date**: 2025-05-16
- **Objective**: To reveal and characterize the presence of a previously unreported polar phase of WO$_3$ stabilized by epitaxial strain in thin films grown on YAlO$_3$ substrates.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial strain stabilizes a triclinic phase of WO$_3$, whose unit cell was fully determined by large-scale reciprocal space mapping. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations of strain gradients around domain walls and local variations of octahedral tilts explain the stabilization of this phase up to unexpectedly large film thicknesses. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) maps evidenced the polar nature and local conductivity modulations, opening possibilities for new functionalities in WO$_3$-based devices.

- **Date**: 2025-05-14
- **Objective**: To investigate the role of structural modulations in tuning the optical properties of Sr$_x$TiS$_3$ compounds and achieve atomic-scale control over these modulations for enhanced colossal optical anisotropy.
- **Finding**: The study reports further enhancement of colossal optical anisotropy to 2.5 in Sr$_{1.143}$TiS$_3$ by controlling the periodicity of atomic-scale modulations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict an indirect-to-direct band gap transition and increased occupancy of Ti-$d_{z^2}$ states for $x \geq 1.143$, leading to maximum birefringence. Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the feasibility of synthesizing Sr$_x$TiS$_3$ with varied modulation periodicities, demonstrating compositional tunability of optical properties in these quasi-1D chalcogenides.

- **Authors**: Songge Li, Nicolas Gauquelin, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Arno Annys, Chuang Gao, Christoph Hofer, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
- **Date**: 2025-05-14
- **Objective**: To propose and validate two strategies for improving aberration correction performance in single sideband (SSB) analytical electron ptychography under low-dose conditions.

- **Authors**: Shunsuke Hayashi, Dongxue Han, Hidenori Tsuji, Kyoko Ishizaka, Asuka Nakamura
- **Date**: 2025-05-09
- **Objective**: To develop a precession Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) system capable of suppressing non-magnetic diffraction contrast for improved high-resolution imaging of magnetic textures.
- **Finding**: The developed precession LTEM system significantly reduces diffraction contrast by precessing the incident electron beam, with the reduction increasing with precession angle ($\theta$). While large $\theta$ values broaden magnetic contrast, optimization of $\theta$ is crucial. Defocus-dependent measurements revealed improved magnetic contrast at small defocus values, suggesting that precession LTEM can achieve higher spatial resolution. This advancement in Lorentz transmission electron microscopy enhances the ability to study magnetic dynamics by providing clearer magnetic images.

- **Authors**: Yangfan Li, Yue Pan, Xincheng Lei, Weiwei Chen, Yang Shen, Mengshu Ge, Xiaozhi Liu, Dong Su
- **Date**: 2025-05-07
- **Objective**: To propose and validate a Multi-Defocus Fusion (MDF) method for reliably differentiating distinct single atoms, particularly in single-atom catalysts (SACs), using High-Angle Annular Dark-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM).
- **Finding**: Multi-slice simulations showed that defocus, support thickness, and interatomic height can make different atoms indistinguishable in HAADF-STEM, especially at certain convergence angles. The proposed Multi-Defocus Fusion (MDF) method, which retrieves Z-contrast from serial images acquired at multiple defocus values, was experimentally validated on a Fe/Pt SAC sample, yielding clearly separated intensity histograms for Fe and Pt atoms. This work provides a robust and easy-to-implement strategy for accurate single-atom identification in HAADF-STEM, offering valuable guidance for the design of high-performance SACs.

- **Date**: 2025-05-06
- **Objective**: To study the phase stability, nanostructure design, and mechanical properties of epitaxial Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ thin films grown on MgO(001) substrates, focusing on self-organized three-dimensional superstructures and spinodal decomposition.
- **Finding**: Single-crystal c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ films (for $x < 0.30$) exhibited spinodal decomposition during deposition, resulting in a three-dimensional checkerboard superstructure of AlN-rich and HfN-rich nanodomains. Lattice-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and x-ray/electron diffraction revealed the superstructure period along <100> directions, which scales with Al content. This self-organized nanostructure, clearly visualized by STEM, leads to a sharp increase in nanoindentation hardness due to dislocation pinning at the superstructure strain fields, demonstrating a pathway for designing multifunctional ceramics with enhanced mechanical properties.

- **Authors**: Simon Fichtner, Mohamed Yassine, Chris van de Walle, Oliver Ambacher
- **Date**: 2025-05-06
- **Objective**: To resolve the ambiguity regarding the orientation of spontaneous polarization in wurtzite crystal structures, particularly for III-N compounds, by reviewing available reports and atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy images.
- **Finding**: By reviewing experimental data and atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, the study clarifies that a metal-polar unit cell in wurtzite structures (e.g., AlScN, GaN) must be associated with an upward polarization vector, contrary to long-standing conventional wisdom. Atomically resolved STEM images were crucial in providing direct visual evidence of the atomic arrangements and polarity, which is fundamental for understanding and predicting carrier types and densities at heterostructure interfaces in wurtzite semiconductors.
