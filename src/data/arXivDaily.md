**1. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of the large sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of $UTe_{2}$ at ambient conditions.
- **Finding**: The study revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices consistent with the expected $Immm$ structure and no uranium vacancies using single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the $Te_{2}$ layers that host Te chains along the b-axis. STEM was crucial in directly visualizing these nanoscale interstitial defects, which are argued to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state and explain the observed property variations, highlighting the need for structurally ordered single crystals for future research.

**3. [Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17801v1)**
- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate imaging strategies for characterizing the structure of 3D DNA origami nanostructures using transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was found to consistently deliver the highest contrast for both stained and unstained DNA origami, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining, and 3D molds largely retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which also improved visibility. This study establishes STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami, even for unstained samples, providing practical guidelines for reliable structural visualization.

- **Finding**: The researchers developed four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, enabling direct tracking of 3D atomic rearrangements in identical nanoparticles throughout electrocatalytic cycles. Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles, they observed two stages of evolution: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, corroborated by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. This technique allowed for the identification of atomic-level chemical short-range order and anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations, highlighting the importance of 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions in nanocatalyst design.

- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To investigate size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in $1T-TiSe_{2}$ nanoflakes.
- **Finding**: Using in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperatures down to 20 K, the researchers observed a melting point depression of the CDW for $1T-TiSe_{2}$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. This phenomenon, where the CDW transition temperature decreases as flake size approaches the correlation length, was successfully explained by a Ginzburg-Landau model, demonstrating that an electronic phase transition can follow classical nucleation theory. Electron microscopy was essential for directly observing the CDW formation and melting within individual nanoflakes at cryogenic temperatures.

**8. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To develop a method for correcting scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements to accurately estimate the true surface pore size and porosity of nanoporous membranes, accounting for imaging artifacts.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings in SEM systematically underestimate membrane porosity and pore size. Imaging at 1 kV vs. 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% to 6.3%, and increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54%. A digital correction method, simulating pore dilation, was developed to estimate uncoated membrane structures, revealing significantly larger porosities (23% for UF, 20% for RO support) and mean pore diameters (2-fold for UF, 1.5-fold for RO support) than previously understood. SEM was the primary characterization tool, and the developed correction method enhances the reliability of SEM for nanoscale pore analysis.

- **Objective**: To directly observe the atomic-scale polarization switching pathways and oxygen site dynamics in fluorite ferroelectrics like $ZrO_{2}$ and $Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_{2}$.
- **Finding**: Using optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the researchers directly visualized oxygen site dynamics in freestanding membranes, revealing that 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, the study also showed how different cation species impact accessible polarization switching pathways. This atomic-column imaging technique provided unprecedented insights into the fundamental mechanisms of ferroelectricity in these materials, crucial for designing next-generation non-volatile memory devices.

Dunin-Borkowski, Michael Farle, Bai-Xiang Xu, Leopoldo Molina-Luna, Oliver Gutfleisch, Baptiste Gault, Konstantin Skokov
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanism of substantial coercivity in $Ce(Co_{1-x}Cu_{x})_{5}$ permanent magnets by identifying nanoscale pinning centers.
- **Finding**: Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), the researchers directly identified a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition in $Ce(Co_{0.8}Cu_{0.2})_{5.4}$ magnets. This structure consists of Cu-poor cylindrical cells (~5-10 nm in diameter) with a disordered $CeCo_{5}$-type structure and Cu-rich cell boundaries (~5 nm thick) with a modified $CeCo_{5}$ structure. These nanoscale chemical segregations, visualized by TEM and APT, create spatial variations in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, leading to effective pinning and high coercivity, providing a microstructural basis for "giant intrinsic magnetic hardness."

- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To understand the underlying degradation mechanisms and identify morphological and chemical changes in Cd-free colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) during operation.
- **Finding**: The study observed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer, QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer of InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs during operation. This was accompanied by the generation and diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen radicals. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was crucial for revealing that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates $ZnMgO$ nanoparticle coarsening. The findings established causal relationships between morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and device instability, leading to a scalable encapsulation treatment that dramatically improved device lifetimes.

Ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps were used to validate predictions of microstructure size and orientation variations driven by laser processing parameters. This approach significantly lowers computational cost and provides crucial insights for in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in additive manufacturing.

- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and ptychography phase imaging using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The study applied detective quantum efficiency (DQE) as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance to electron microscopy. It found that for a weak-phase object, ptychography cannot reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but is more robust to partial coherence. This work provides a quantitative framework for evaluating and comparing the performance of advanced electron microscopy techniques like HRTEM and ptychography, especially for dose-sensitive materials.

**16. [Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO2(100) Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11568v1)**
- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To understand and control the atomic structure of the polar $CeO_{2}(100)$ surface and its reconstruction behavior, which is essential for surface reactivity and catalytic material design.
- **Finding**: The study discovered a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the $CeO_{2}(100)$ surface, characterized by an alternating arrangement of $Ce^{3+}$ and $Ce^{4+}$ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), combined with global structure search, machine learning, and DFT calculations, was crucial for the direct observation and validation of this reconstructed surface. The findings reveal that orbital hybridization, driven by localized $Ce^{3+}$ polarons, activates surface O 2p states, enhancing electron-donating capacity and facilitating molecule dissociation, providing a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism for tuning catalytic performance.

- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating the capabilities of AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), in materials characterization and analysis.
- **Finding**: MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Preliminary evaluations showed that advanced multi-modal AI models achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks. While not a direct electron microscopy research paper, it highlights the increasing role of electron microscopy data (SEM, TEM) in the training and evaluation of AI models for materials science, demonstrating their potential for automated analysis.

- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To uncover and characterize intrinsic quantum clusters, specifically localized intrinsic point defects, on the surface of the magnetic Weyl semimetal $Co_{3}Sn_{2}S_{2}$ and understand their role in shaping electronic states.
- **Finding**: The study uncovered intrinsic quantum clusters, identified as native oxygen defects, dominating the intrinsic defect landscape on both Sn- and S-terminated surfaces of $Co_{3}Sn_{2}S_{2}$. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)/electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), were used to directly observe and characterize these clusters. STEM/EELS provided crucial elemental and structural information, confirming the oxygen interstitial nature of these defects and their impact on tuning the flat band near the Fermi level and generating distinct impurity states with varying symmetries and magnetic responses.

**19. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study found that ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position, while atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Spiral scanning under cryogenic conditions improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions. This work, relying on advanced STEM techniques, establishes practical guidelines for implementing programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM, highlighting ptychography's inherent resilience to trajectory-induced artifacts.

- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the "nanosculpting" of lateral weak link junctions in superconducting $Fe(Te,Se)/Bi_{2}Te_{3}$ thin films using a focused $Si^{++}$ ion beam (FIB) and investigate its implications on vortex pinning.
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully nanosculpted ~100 nm-wide channels into $FeTe_{0.75}Se_{0.25}/Bi_{2}Te_{3}$ films using FIB, systematically suppressing critical temperature ($T_{c}$) and critical current ($I_{c}$) with increasing ion dose, confirming the creation of a controllable weak link. Kelvin probe force microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) corroborated the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region. SEM was crucial for visualizing the nanoscale channels created by FIB, and the study found that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, offering a scalable pathway for Josephson junction fabrication and engineering robust qubits.

- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in $In_{2}Se_{3}$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and understand the underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable NDR with high peak-to-valley ratios in $In_{2}Se_{3}$ FeS-FETs, attributing it to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha-2H$ phase to a high-resistance state. High-resolution electron microscopy was critical for ex-situ atomic-scale imaging, revealing that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments generating Moiré patterns, and intralayer shear, all contributing to stress-induced phase transitions. These mechanistic insights highlight the potential of 2D ferroelectric devices for multifunctional nanoelectronics.

- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: To study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide ($MoS_{2}$) nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and explain experimental observations of phonon edge states.
- **Finding**: MD simulations revealed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes as the nanoparticle edges are approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained these observations by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge. This work underscores the necessity of full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation, demonstrating how HR-TEM can visualize subtle atomic vibrations and phonon edge states.

- **Finding**: The study developed a dual-branch multimodal VAE trained on paired spectra-image data, enabling prediction of Au NR geometries (orientation and aspect ratio) using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. Electron microscopy images were crucial as the ground truth for training the VAE and validating its predictions against physics-based fitting. The VAE achieved comparable performance to physics-based methods even with a small training set (300 particles), demonstrating a promising approach for inverse nano-optical problems by learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology.

- **Finding**: The researchers achieved tunable synthesis of the previously unreported distorted octahedral $1T'$ $CrS_{2}$ phase, along with $1T$ $CrS_{2}$ and $Cr_{2}S_{3}$. The phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory, and 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction. 4D-STEM characterization was crucial in revealing a complex transformation process from $1T$ to $1T'$, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented $1T'$ crystals, providing insights into the synthesis and magnetic properties of these 2D chromium chalcogenides.

- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To directly resolve the atomic-scale antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition pathway in $PbZrO_{3}$ thin films under applied electric fields using operando electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study employed operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) electric field biasing to directly resolve a multi-step antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in $PbZrO_{3}$ thin films, including several metastable phases. Atomic-resolution imaging and complementary nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic scale analysis revealed that this pathway and its end states could be modulated, leading to a "dead layer" near the substrate with suppressed switching. Operando electron microscopy was essential for observing dynamic phase transformations between coexisting phases at a transition front, driven by competing internal and external fields, providing critical experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions.

**26. [3D Mapping of Defects and Moiré Corrugations via Electron Ptychography Atomic Coordinate Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07140v1)**
-   **Authors**: Jeffrey Huang, Yichao Zhang, Sang hyun Bae, Ballal Ahammed, Elif Ertekin, Pinshane Y. Huang
-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To experimentally access and solve the 3D atomic coordinates of defects and moiré corrugations in 2D moiré materials, which strongly modify their electronic properties.
-   **Finding**: The study successfully solved the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer accuracy using multislice electron ptychography (MEP) from a single orientation. This allowed for the visualization of individual atomic planes, revealing layer curvature, interlayer spacing variations, and the 3D locations of vacancies (exclusively in outer Se planes). A new type of structural disorder with mixed bending- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations was observed. Electron ptychography enabled the generation of 3D atom-by-atom models of a 2D heterointerface in about 30 seconds, providing routine access to 3D atomic information in 2D systems.

**27. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v2)**
-   **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and the underlying mechanism of hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
-   **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies showed intergranular and quasi-cleavage crack initiation. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and confirmed $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking during predominant brittle fracture. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies on cross-sectional cracks supported the explanation of HE via hydrogen-induced fast fracture, where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to crack tips promotes brittle fracture at high velocities, inhibiting crack blunting. TEM observations also explained the formation of river pattern features on the $\{100\}$ cleavage surface.

**28. [Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166v1)**
-   **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
-   **Date**: 2025-09-07
-   **Objective**: To investigate how dopants self-organize and alter local structure within amorphous interfacial complexions in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys.
-   **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and elemental analysis revealed chemical partitioning in both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries. The amorphous-crystalline transition region was found to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others. While nanobeam electron diffraction provided qualitative structural short-range order, atomistic simulations with a machine learning potential showed that increased grain boundary chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to transition regions driving local structural changes sensitive to dopant ratios.

A bilayer recipe enabled the creation of freestanding membranes with high-quality nanopatterns, circumventing etching-induced defects. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the suspended membrane, and nanoindentation with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip extracted position-dependent spring constant and pretension. The all-polymer metasurface experimentally achieved high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, despite the polymer's low refractive index, demonstrating straightforward geometry-based tuning of linewidth and resonance position.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-04
-   **Objective**: To investigate thickness-induced topological phase transitions in $\alpha$-Sn films grown on CdTe(110) using helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC) and to identify experimental methods to tune and distinguish these phases.
-   **Finding**: HDPC measurements showed a thickness-dependent behavior, with 5 nm $\alpha$-Sn exhibiting an odd-function dependence on incident angle, while 10 and 30 nm films showed an even-function dependence. Combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, this revealed a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a 2D to a 3D topological insulator occurring between 5 and 10 nm. HR-TEM provided crucial structural information supporting the phase transition. These results establish HDPC as a sensitive diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions and highlight the tunability of $\alpha$-Sn(110) films.

This framework, employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal. Artifact removal is achieved using LEDITS++ with a pre-trained diffusion model, allowing natural language specification of artifacts. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets showed significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, validated by metrics like PSNR and diffraction pattern consistency. This work highlights a transferable and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging, which is highly relevant to electron ptychography by improving image quality.

**35. [Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00943v1)**
-   **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
-   **Date**: 2025-08-31

-   **Finding**: The study developed a protocol using unsupervised machine learning on 4D-STEM data. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA), cluster validation (t-SNE, UMAP), and k-means clustering, four distinct clusters were identified. Mapping these back to diffraction data and analyzing elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures (e.g., oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, germanium in Cluster 4) and structural variations across clusters. This demonstrated that clustering analysis of 4D-STEM data provides a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.

-   **Authors**: Tomoya Nakatani, Nattamon Suwannaharn, Taisuke Sasaki
-   **Date**: 2025-08-29
-   **Objective**: To investigate the structure and anisotropic electrical resistivity of single-crystalline CoSn kagome metal thin films with respect to crystallographic orientation, for potential application in interconnects.
-   **Finding**: Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films was achieved on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer. The films exhibited low resistivity along [0001] and an approximately tenfold anisotropy, consistent with bulk CoSn. However, the CoSn(10-10) surface showed pronounced roughness due to 3D crystal growth. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films. STEM was crucial in characterizing the microstructure, identifying growth facets and domain boundaries, which are important for understanding the challenges in employing CoSn for interconnects.

-   **Authors**: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
-   **Date**: 2025-08-29
-   **Objective**: To grow epitaxial 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy and characterize their structural and electronic properties, exploring their integration potential.
-   **Finding**: High substrate growth temperature (825$^\circ$C) induced optimal structural properties of the 2H-TaS$_2$ overlayer, as confirmed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED). The 2D overlayer grew unstrained after monolayer deposition. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provided evidence of pits at the interface, likely due to GaN thermal decomposition at high temperatures. In-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) indicated electron transfer from n-GaN(0001) to 2H-TaS$_2$ and nitrogen vacancy formation near the interface, but no chemical reaction, corroborating the possibility of integrating 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with 3D semiconducting GaN. STEM was essential for direct visualization of interfacial defects.

-   **Finding**: An alternative chemical etching method using sulfuric acid was presented, demonstrating the removal of 3.7 $\mu$m of material from the titanium surface over 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the surface morphology and contamination, confirming the effective removal of surface contaminants after etching. This proposed method offers a safer and effective alternative to conventional hydrofluoric acid etching for preparing radiopure titanium components.

-   **Finding**: The oxygen getter assisted thermal annealing successfully triggered a topotactic phase transition from PV to BM in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3-\delta}$ thin films, confirmed by X-ray Diffraction. This transition was accompanied by a change from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic state and metallic to insulating state. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was employed, along with X-ray Reflectivity and Atomic Force Microscopy, to reveal surface segregation and cation redistribution during the annealing process. STEM provided crucial microstructural details of the phase transformation and element redistribution.

-   **Objective**: To control polarization direction and chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films by investigating the interplay between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain.
-   **Finding**: Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that anisotropic compressive strain promotes ferroelectric domain formation, and the nanoscale domain architecture is stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the buffer. By inserting a Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer, a uniform out-of-plane polarization was stabilized in highly strained BFO films. STEM provided critical high-resolution imaging to visualize the domain architecture and the Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer, elucidating the polarization compensation mechanism and enabling new strategies for controlling polarization and chiral textures.

-   **Date**: 2025-08-28
-   **Objective**: To develop a machine learning framework that can predict energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps directly from 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) diffraction patterns, thereby reducing beam exposure and acquisition time during materials characterization.
-   **Finding**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed and demonstrated to accurately infer elemental compositions from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations (e.g., Oxygen and Tellurium). Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies showed consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural context was available. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirmed the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends. This approach establishes a data-driven pathway to non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization by leveraging the rich structural information from 4D-STEM to predict chemical information usually obtained by EDS.

-   **Objective**: To explore a new approach for improving the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising semiconductor limited by its intrinsic brittleness, by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations.
-   **Finding**: Surface scratching with a Brinell indenter along the [100] direction effectively generated edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for surface morphology analysis and microstructural characterization, revealing that these introduced dislocations significantly mitigated cleavage crack formation during nanoindentation, in contrast to as-received $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers played a crucial role in preventing brittle fracture by facilitating stable plastic deformation.

-   **Finding**: The study presents a method for 3D strain field reconstruction based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which arise from strain field variations along the electron beam direction. The method was tested against simulated data with known ground truth and successfully applied to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer. This 4D-STEM based technique provides a significant advancement in quantitatively mapping 3D strain fields, crucial for understanding and engineering material properties.

-   **Date**: 2025-08-25
-   **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced experimental techniques with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that broad transitional regions observed in previous STEM images, interpreted as transient nonpolar intermediate phases, are actually projection artifacts from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of $180^\circ$ domain walls. This was confirmed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Simulations revealed that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, consistent with nucleation-limited switching and explaining the zigzag domain walls. STEM was critical in providing atomic-scale structural evidence to reinterpret the switching mechanism.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs, induced by annealing or laser heating, and to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential for phase-change memory applications.
-   **Finding**: The study observed a phase transition where highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe while preserving crystal orientation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to investigate the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface, revealing the clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures as a key mechanism driving the transition, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through minor GeSe$_2$ phase segregation. The high electrical resistance contrast ($\sim 10^7$) between the polymorphs highlights GeSe's potential for electronic applications.

-   **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
-   **Date**: 2025-08-23
-   **Objective**: To investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations within the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand its underlying mechanisms and impact on mechanical properties.
-   **Finding**: The study reported a novel cross-slip of Shockley partial dislocations from one $\{111\}$ plane to another $\{111\}$ conjugate plane, facilitated by stair-rod dislocation formation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize defects (stacking faults, dislocations) and associated chemical fluctuations. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies. Local stress concentrations also played a role. The formation of sessile stair-rod dislocations via this mechanism enhances high-temperature deformation resistance, demonstrating the critical role of HRSTEM/EDS in elucidating atomic-scale deformation mechanisms.

It proposes and discusses alternative optics that can maximize total photon detection rates and broaden the tolerable bandwidth for broadband x-ray ptychography. While this paper focuses on x-ray ptychography optics, the principles of ptychography are shared with electron ptychography, and advancements in x-ray optics could inspire similar developments or considerations for electron beam shaping in electron ptychography, although the direct contribution of electron microscopy is not the core.

-   **Finding**: The (CoNi)$_{81}$Mo$_{12}$Al$_7$ alloy demonstrated exceptional mechanical properties (yield strength 1086 MPa, tensile strength 1520 MPa, ductility 35%). Dislocation analysis via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations, showed that Mo substitution in the L1$_2$ phase altered dislocation behavior, promoting multiple deformation modes including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These behaviors were facilitated by low stacking fault energy of the FCC matrix and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries. TEM was indispensable for visualizing and characterizing these complex deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale, providing direct evidence for the role of L1$_2$ nanoprecipitates and elemental segregation in enhancing mechanical properties.

-   **Finding**: Molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments identified an incorporation-limited deposition regime enabling 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio and single-phase CaMoO$_4$ formation, which could be in-situ doped with Er. Electron microscopy (along with X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction) studies confirmed that growth on silicon substrates resulted in single-phase but polycrystalline films, while growth on YSZ substrates yielded high-quality epitaxial single-crystalline CaMoO$_4$ films. Preliminary optical and microwave characterization of epitaxial films provided key parameters like inhomogeneous linewidth, excited state lifetime, and homogeneous linewidth. Electron microscopy was crucial for characterizing the film morphology and crystallinity, distinguishing between polycrystalline and epitaxial growth, which directly impacts the optical and microwave properties.
