- **Date**: 2025-06-19
- **Objective**: To synthesize tin disulfide (SnS$_2$) nanotubes with a preferred chiral angle using a sacrificial template and to elucidate the mechanism behind this chirality-selective growth.
- **Finding**: SnS$_2$ nanotubes with a preferred armchair configuration (approximately 85% probability) were successfully synthesized inside boron nitride nanotube templates. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction, key electron microscopy techniques, revealed this armchair preference and the presence of zigzag SnS$_2$ nanoribbons connected to the nanotube ends. Crucially, in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) provided real-time visualization of the transformation of these zigzag nanoribbons into armchair nanotubes, verifying the "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis and marking the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth for transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.

- **Date**: 2025-06-19
- **Objective**: To synthesize spherical bismuth nanoparticles and investigate their structural and optical (plasmonic) properties at the single-particle level.
- **Finding**: Spherical bismuth nanoparticles (50-600 nm) were synthesized, and their structural and optical properties were investigated at the single-particle level using analytical transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrated that bismuth nanoparticles support localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) which can be tuned from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet spectral region by changing the nanoparticle size. This highlights their attractiveness for wide-spectral-range plasmonic applications, benefiting from bismuth's lower cost, biocompatibility, and oxidation resistance.

- **Authors**: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas Müller, Andreas Bezold, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Objective**: To overcome the limitation of current electron microscopy techniques for stacking fault analysis, enabling full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals.
- **Finding**: A novel high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) method was introduced that enables full structural discrimination of inclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals, breaking the long-standing edge-on geometric constraint for high-resolution analysis. This approach leverages fault-induced de-channeling, which is key to contrast formation and strongly governed by the fault's depth within the sample, as revealed by simulations. The robustness of the method was demonstrated in a CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even in overlapping configurations and thick foils, and also establishing a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM lamellae bounded by the stacking fault itself for enhanced atomic-scale studies.

- **Authors**: M. D. Dong, X. B. Cheng, M. Zhang, J. Wu
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Objective**: To discover and investigate the coexistence and strong coupling of ferroelectric and superconducting orders at the interface of LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$(111) (LAO/KTO).
- **Finding**: Ferroelectric order was discovered at the LAO/KTO interface, coexisting with superconductivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was instrumental in revealing the atomic displacements of K ions relative to Ta ions, aided by oxygen vacancies at the interface, which are responsible for the ferroelectricity. This ferroelectricity, confirmed also by second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM), was shown to be locally switchable, and manipulating it could change interfacial conductivity by over 1000 times, causing superconductivity to diminish and reappear, demonstrating a strong coupling between these phenomena.

- **Date**: 2025-06-17
- **Objective**: To explore polarization switching and associated phenomena, including ferroelectric subsystems and electrochemical reactivity, on the open surfaces of wurtzite ferroelectric nitrides using multidimensional high-resolution piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy.
- **Finding**: The study revealed the presence of two weakly coupled ferroelectric subsystems and bias-induced electrochemical reactivity during polarization switching on wurtzite ferroelectric nitrides. While the primary technique was PFM, the authors explicitly state that these PFM-based studies are fully consistent with recent electron microscopy observations of shark-teeth like ferroelectric domains in nitrides, implying that electron microscopy has previously provided crucial structural insights into these domain behaviors that are now being correlated with PFM-observed switching dynamics, establishing a universal phenomenological picture of polarization switching in binary wurtzite materials.

- **Finding**: Mn substitution in GeCo$_2$O$_4$ leads to unexpected phase separation in Ge$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Co$_2$O$_4$, forming a Mn-rich primary phase and a Ge-rich secondary phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was crucial in revealing these distinct phases and their approximate stoichiometries, providing direct evidence of the structural inhomogeneities. This phase separation significantly impacts the low-temperature structural and magnetic properties, leading to suppressed magneto-structural coupling and distinct magnetic ordering behaviors in the two phases.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), specifically electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), revealed the segregation of Mn and depletion of Ni at grain boundaries. These observations were further corroborated by atom probe tomography (APT), which additionally showed segregation of O and depletion of Li and Na (an impurity) at grain boundaries. The study also found segregation of O and Mn and depletion of Li at dislocations, providing further support for the observed segregation behavior and offering new insights to improve battery material synthesis and efficiency.

- **Authors**: Marco Moreira, Yves Fleming, Patrick Grysan, Christele Vergne, Adrian Marie Philippe, Petru Lunca-Popa
- **Date**: 2025-06-16
- **Objective**: To investigate how various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) influence the structure and properties of Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.
- **Finding**: Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films were grown with various extrinsic dopants, revealing that actual dopant incorporation was well below nominal targets, with only Al and Sc present above detection. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided crucial structural insights, indicating that films grown on c-plane sapphire were epitaxial near the substrate interface but relaxed into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon were polycrystalline throughout. Despite limited dopant incorporation, subtle structural and optical shifts were observed, suggesting that dopant precursor chemistry and growth conditions significantly influence film stoichiometry and properties.

- **Objective**: To design artificial sulfur-free zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by controlling their chain length through thermal annealing.
- **Finding**: Artificial sulfur-free zinc phosphate tribofilms, initially classified as metaphosphates, were shown to have their chain lengths reduced upon annealing. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line scans confirmed that the composition change observed on the surface by XPS, indicative of chain length reduction, occurred throughout the entire thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length led to a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and improved wear resistance, demonstrating that the mechanical properties of these tribofilms can be precisely tailored via thermally stimulated composition changes.

- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: To report the growth and characterization of rock-salt ScN(113) layers on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$/Al$_2$O$_3$$(10\bar{1}0)$ templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy.
- **Finding**: Rock-salt ScN(113) layers were successfully grown on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$/Al$_2$O$_3$$(10\bar{1}0)$ templates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was crucial in confirming the pure (113) surface orientation with rotational twins and identifying two distinct in-plane epitaxial relationships between ScN(113) and AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$. This detailed structural characterization by TEM, combined with X-ray diffractometry, provided insights into the film's epitaxy and allowed for further investigation of its optical and electrical properties.

**50. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: To explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and identify approaches to optimize $Z$ sensitivity.
- **Finding**: The study explored the $Z$-dependence of multislice electron ptychography, demonstrating that $Z$-contrast is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column. It was found that a monotonic $Z$-dependence occurs when integrating over a small region, while increasing the integration area leads to a non-monotonic $Z$-contrast that accentuates differences between elements only a single atomic number apart (e.g., $\beta$-CuZn, $Z=29$ and $30$) even in thick samples ($>20$ nm). This work, inherently focused on an advanced electron microscopy technique, provides crucial insights into optimizing ptychographic $Z$-contrast for specific applications by manipulating the atom column integration area.
