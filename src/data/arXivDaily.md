- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: To determine the intrinsic magnetic properties, specifically anisotropy, at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ permanent magnets using first-principles calculations, informed by experimental high-resolution electron microscopy images.
