- **Objective**: Directly image nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ crystals using Fresnel mode Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) and analyze the limitations of conventional contrast interpretation for ultrasmall skyrmions.
- **Finding**: LTEM successfully imaged the nanometric skyrmion lattices. Analysis of defocus-dependent Fresnel images revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon. Through systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations, this chiral misinterpretation was attributed to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function (CTF), which correlates with both defocus values and the ultrasmall skyrmion dimensions, establishing quantitative limitations for Fresnel contrast analysis at the nanoscale.

**33. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Determine the true origin of the Hall-resistivity anomalies observed in $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet, which mimic the topological Hall effect (THE).
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they lacked correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, suggesting a non-topological origin. Most importantly, Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) measurements were performed and definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures (like skyrmions) in the ferrimagnet. The anomalies were thus attributed to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity, demonstrating that transport measurements alone can be insufficient to identify chiral spin textures in bulk systems.

**34. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: Propose CDIP, a robust, constraint-free phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) that eliminates the need for object-specific constraints by utilizing untrained coordinate-based neural fields and a physics-consistent forward model.
- **Finding**: CDIP substantially outperformed classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability for phase retrieval. This framework is broadly applicable to coherent imaging modalities, including those utilizing electron probes (such as ptychography and holography), offering a paradigm shift for both static and time-resolved reconstruction by overcoming the instability and ill-posedness traditionally associated with CDI.

**35. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: Establish a comprehensive understanding of the three-dimensional strain control mechanisms governing magnetic skyrmion strings, including elongation, tilting, and collapse.
- **Finding**: Analytical modeling and simulations predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, and drives system collapse via bobber formation at critical strain levels. Experimental validation using in situ Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: Investigate and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models when applied to High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images under varying imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: By generating synthetic HRTEM data via multislice simulation, the study demonstrated that neural network segmentation models exhibit significant performance stability but predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift away from the training distribution. The HRTEM Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) was successfully used to develop a framework that compares the information content of datasets and quantifies OOD domain shifts, providing crucial insight for deploying neural networks in experimental HRTEM workflows.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: Investigate the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys, relevant for permanent magnets.
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis of fabricated $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys revealed significant compressive strain (up to $25\%$) near the grain boundaries. Calculations showed that while $K_{\rm u}$ is positive ($4.2$ $\text{MJ/m}^3$) under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with $25\%$ compressive strain, demonstrating the critical influence of lattice distortions observed by STEM on magnetic properties.

- **Authors**: Giannis Thalassinos, Alan G. Salek, Daniel Stavrevski, Qiang Sun, Mitchell O. de Vries, Colin M. MacRae, Nicholas C. Wilson, Andrew G. Tomkins, Dougal G. McCulloch, Andrew D. Greentree
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: Provide the first experimental evidence of a photoluminescent color center in meteoritic lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond), a proposed wide-bandgap host.
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in meteoritic lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable photoluminescence across $550-800$ nm (peak $\sim 700$ nm) with a $14$ ns excited-state lifetime. Correlative electron microscopy was essential to confirm the lonsdaleite host lattice structure, and compositional analysis suggested N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents, indicating that hexagonal diamond may host a new family of solid-state quantum emitters.

**39. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: Observe and understand the spatial evolution and underlying mechanisms of helical domain reorientation in chiral magnets when subjected to quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress.
- **Finding**: Using in situ Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM), the reorientation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) under stress was observed, showing striking similarities to plastic deformation in metals. LTEM revealed that magnetic defects mediate the reorientation through "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes. Simulations suggest that strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a key role, providing a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic nanophase control.

**40. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: Systematically study the emergence and control of Surface Spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) in chiral magnets, focusing on the influence of the intrinsic in-plane directionality governed by the phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that $\phi_0$ acts as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, governing the presence, shape, and topological charge of SS adjacent to FCIs. Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed the formation of SS at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, revealing two distinct formation pathways (thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation).

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: Resolve the thermodynamic paradox of the synthesizability of the metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ solid-state electrolyte by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: DFT calculations and TTT diagrams showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to its low surface energy, which drastically reduces the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation, providing a rational strategy for synthesizing functional metastable materials.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: Achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) exceeding $60$ K in epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset was achieved at $\sim 63$ K, enabled by pushing the GAE growth method into an extreme non-equilibrium regime. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), alongside synchrotron X-ray diffraction, confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity of the epitaxial films, successfully overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. The films exhibited strange-metal-like behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$) at higher $T_c$ and demonstrated significantly stronger interlayer coupling than cuprates.

- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) denoising pipeline specifically for time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that also demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.
- **Finding**: The proposed pipeline, which integrates a blind-spot convolution neural network, significantly outperformed other ML and non-ML methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features in HRTEM images. Crucially, the model's computational inference speed is in the order of milliseconds per image and it demonstrated excellent OOD generalization, making it suitable for high-speed, low-dose in situ HRTEM experiments.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2-\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and resolve the stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive characterization suite was used, including Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, to quantify crystal structure at multiple length-scales and identify boundaries between closely related phases. The study found that kinetic energy quenching in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase even with low Ce content ($20\%$), requiring an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice ($\sim 16.7\%$), a structure confirmed by multi-length-scale characterization.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Engineer the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ thin films by utilizing various perovskite oxide heterointerfaces ($\text{LaTiO}_3$, $\text{LaMnO}_3$, $\text{LaAlO}_3$, $\text{LaNiO}_3$).
- **Finding**: Interfacial engineering successfully tuned the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state. High-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging was crucial in revealing a clear connection between the strain induced at the oxide interface and the resulting Co spin configuration, demonstrating that interfacial engineering simultaneously governs both orbital occupancy and spin state in correlated oxides.

- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Discover a high-pressure and compositionally controlled synthesis route to create a new class of hexagonal $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions, which are desirable for optoelectronic applications.
- **Finding**: By subjecting Ge and Sn to pressures of $9$ and $10$ GPa and high temperatures, ambient-pressure recoverable hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions were successfully synthesized. Precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy confirmed the crystal symmetry and composition of these new hexagonal structures, which are accessible below $21$ atom $\%$ Sn, thereby creating a new binary materials landscape.

**47. [On the relation between microstructure and impact toughness of 17-4__PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14702v1)**
- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Establish quantitative correlations between the multiscale microstructural evolution induced by aging heat treatments and the resulting quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties (impact toughness) of PBF-LB produced 17-4 PH stainless steel.
- **Finding**: PBF-LB specimens showed high tensile strength but significantly lower impact toughness than conventional counterparts. Multiscale characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) identified $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions (from the powder) as detrimental nucleation sites for micro-cavities. TEM observations of $\text{Cu}$-rich nanoprecipitates showed their distribution could be tailored to favor either tensile strength or impact toughness, but not simultaneously, highlighting a pronounced strength-toughness trade-off.

**48. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Evaluate the influence of critical instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations demonstrated that DPC-STEM measurements are highly sensitive to instrumental configuration. For a $21$ mrad probe, defocus errors can underestimate the electrostatic field magnitude by $10\%$ to $16\%$. Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations surpassing $40\%$ for magnitudes below $3$ nm. The analysis confirms the sensitivity and usefulness of DPC-STEM but underscores the necessity of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate atomic-resolution electrostatic mapping.

- **Finding**: Nanopores fabricated by various methods (electroporation, TEM drilling, HF etching) were successfully sealed by the in situ synthesis of iron oxide particles, with sealing timescales ranging from $\sim 1$ ms to $\sim 3.6$ s. Aberration-corrected Scanning TEM (AC-STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) were used to verify the synthesis and composition of the mixed magnetite and maghemite iron oxide particles within the nanopores.

- **Finding**: A reproducible, transfer-free, catalyst-free CVD route was established for growing uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all tested perovskite oxide substrates under shared optimal conditions. Electron microscopy was part of the comprehensive characterization confirming the structural quality. The resulting $\text{graphene}/\text{SrTiO}_3$ heterostructure exhibited cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.
