**1. [Control of thin NbN film superconducting properties by ScN buffer layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13367v1)**
- **Authors**: N. V. Porokhov, M. A. Dryazgov, A. R. Shevchenko, A. M. Mumlyakov, Z. S. Enbaev, Yu. V. Blinova, D. I. Devyaterikov, Yu. P. Korneeva, A. A. Korneev, M. A. Tarkhov
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the effect of a scandium nitride ($\text{ScN}$) buffer layer on the superconducting properties of thin niobium nitride ($\text{NbN}$) films.
- **Finding**: The $\text{ScN}$ buffer layer significantly improved the characteristics of 29 nm thick $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing the critical temperature $T_c$ from 9 K to 12.5 K and decreasing resistivity. These enhancements are attributed to better lattice matching between $\text{NbN}$ and $\text{ScN}$, resulting in a higher quality crystal lattice of the $\text{NbN}$ film, as confirmed by **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** data.

**2. [Hydrothermal synthesis of SnO2 particles for the degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) dye in presence of sunlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13137v1)**
- **Authors**: Komal Singh, Jyoti Sindkar, Mrunal Ramdasi, Vrishali Jadhav, Rohidas B. Kale
- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: To synthesize tin dioxide ($\text{SnO}_2$) nanoparticles using the hydrothermal method and examine how surfactants affect their structural, morphological, and photocatalytic characteristics.
- **Finding**: $\text{SnO}_2$ nanoparticles formed a highly crystalline tetragonal rutile phase. Changes in surfactant concentration significantly impacted the size and shape of the nanoparticles, with higher precursor concentrations leading to aggregation. The sample containing PEG as a surfactant exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for Methylene Blue degradation. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** was utilized to examine the resulting morphological and crystallographic characteristics.

**3. [Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814v1)**
- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: To report a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in ferroelectric $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ at room temperature and determine its physical origin.
- **Finding**: A strong magnetically coupled EO effect was observed, stemming from defect-bound unpaired electrons responsible for DC drift. This slow polarization relaxation is quenched by the magnetic-field-induced formation of room-temperature skyrmion states, resulting in an enhanced EO efficiency (up to 34 pm/V in $\text{LiNbO}_3$). **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** was used to directly visualize the collective spin ordering (skyrmion states) induced by the magnetic field.

- **Authors**: A. A. Shiryaev, E. F. Vasilev, A. L. Vasilev, V. V. Artemov, N. V. Gubanov, D. A. Zedgenizov
- **Date**: 2025-12-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural defects, particularly Y-defects, and their correlation with spectroscopic properties in a natural Ib-IaA diamond crystal.
- **Finding**: An anticorrelation was observed between the spatial distribution of nitrogen-related A and C centers and the intensity of infrared absorption. The Y-defect rich zone contained dislocations and numerous clusters of point defects. **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** revealed extended defects (1-3 nm thick, up to 20 nm long rhombic plates) identified as nanosized voids (vacancy clusters), which are suggested to be the origin of the observed blinking photoluminescence lines.

- **Authors**: Zhaoyi Joy Zheng, Haosen Guan, Danrui Ni, Guangming Cheng, Yanyu Jia, Ipsita Das, Yue Tang, Ayelet July Uzan-Narovlansky, Lihan Shi, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Nan Yao, Robert J Cava, Sanfeng Wu
- **Date**: 2025-12-12
- **Objective**: To introduce and demonstrate the concept of using van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for the confined synthesis of high-quality single crystals of quantum materials.
- **Finding**: The vdW nanoreactor successfully synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of $\text{Pd-Te}$ compounds, including non-stoichiometric $\text{PdTe}_{1-x}$ ($x \sim 0.18$) which exhibited superconductivity below $3.8$ K. **Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** confirmed the exceptional high crystalline quality of the resulting products, validating the effectiveness of the nanoconfined synthesis method.

- **Authors**: Connie M. Wang, Roberta M. Sabino, Aditya Garg, Ahmed E. Salih, Loza F. Tadesse, Elazer R. Edelman
- **Date**: 2025-12-12
- **Objective**: To develop a multifunctional, self-sensing implant material composed of gold nano-columns on titanium ($\text{AuNC-Ti}$) that acts as a nanoengineered surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate for non-invasive monitoring of tissue-implant interactions.
- **Finding**: $\text{AuNC-Ti}$ substrates, fabricated via oblique angle deposition (OAD), showed uniform $\text{AuNC}$ formation ($360 \pm 40$ nm length, $50 \pm 16$ nm width) and achieved a high median SERS enhancement factor (EF) of $1.8 \times 10^5$. This enabled multiplexed, spatial identification of biological components at the interface. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** was used to characterize the uniform morphology and dimensions of the gold nano-columns.

**7. [Thermal and Size Effects in Ferroelastic Domains by Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10629v1)**
- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of temperature on the thickness-dependent behavior of ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films, spanning the dipolar and crossover regimes.
- **Finding**: A distinct interplay between temperature and thickness was identified. In the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm), DWs were mobile near $T_C$ ($\approx 550^\circ$C) and froze upon cooling. Conversely, in the crossover regime (200-300 nm), DWs remained nearly static with minimal reconfiguration. This mapping provides insight into domain evolution across thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes. **In situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**, coupled with machine learning analysis, was used to track DW curvature and density across the temperature range.

**8. [Fresnel Magnetic Imaging of Ultrasmall Skyrmion Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10320v1)**
- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform direct real-space imaging of nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ crystals using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and address challenges in characterizing their chirality.
- **Finding**: Conventional Fresnel contrast analysis yielded an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon. Through systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations, this misinterpretation was attributed to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer function (CTF), which strongly depends on defocus values and ultrasmall skyrmion dimensions. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** in Fresnel mode was used for imaging, and **off-axis electron holography** provided the quantitative verification of the magnetic phase.

**9. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet and determine the true origin of its topological-Hall-like resistivity anomaly.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed, but they showed little correlation with magnetic transitions, distinguishing them from the topological Hall effect associated with chiral spin textures. The anomalies are instead attributed to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Crucially, **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** measurements were performed to definitively rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet.

**10. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust, constraint-free phase-retrieval framework for Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) that utilizes untrained coordinate-based neural fields and a physics-consistent forward model.
- **Finding**: CDIP successfully eliminated the need for handcrafted, object-specific constraints in phase retrieval. It substantially outperformed classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability for both static and dynamic reconstructions. This framework offers a broadly applicable paradigm shift for coherent imaging modalities, including those using **electron** probes (e.g., ptychography and holography).

**11. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings, integrating analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and experimental validation.
- **Finding**: Strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems. Simulations revealed that critical strain levels cause skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation. Experimental validation on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism. **In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** experiments provided direct observation and validation of these strain-mediated manipulation mechanisms.

**12. [Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09067v1)**
- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models used for High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) imaging with respect to varying imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: Neural network segmentation models demonstrated significant performance stability, but their performance smoothly and predictably worsened as imaging conditions shifted away from the training distribution. The study developed a framework using the **HRTEM contrast transfer function (CTF)** to compare information content and quantify OOD domain shifts, utilizing synthetic data generated via multislice simulation.

**13. [Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07285v1)**
- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To investigate the critical influence of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys.
- **Finding**: Calculations showed that while $K_{\rm u}$ is 4.2 $\text{MJ}/\text{m}^3$ under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain, confirming the detrimental effect of distortion on magnetic properties. Pr-rich alloys exhibited a more pronounced reduction in $K_{\rm u}$ under strain compared to $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** revealed a compressive strain of up to 25% near grain boundaries in the fabricated $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys, providing the experimental basis for the theoretical strain modeling.

**14. [A fluorescent color center in meteoritic Lonsdaleite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07146v1)**
- **Authors**: Giannis Thalassinos, Alan G. Salek, Daniel Stavrevski, Qiang Sun, Mitchell O. de Vries, Colin M. MacRae, Nicholas C. Wilson, Andrew G. Tomkins, Dougal G. McCulloch, Andrew D. Greentree
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence of photoluminescent color centers in meteoritic lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond).
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable emission across 550-800 nm (peak at $\sim 700$ nm) with a 14 ns excited-state lifetime and no detectable blinking or bleaching. This suggests lonsdaleite could be a new quantum-grade crystalline platform. **Correlative electron microscopy** confirmed the lonsdaleite host lattice structure, and compositional analysis (likely $\text{EDS}$ or $\text{EELS}$ in an $\text{EM}$ setup) suggested N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents.

**15. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To observe and mechanistically understand the spatial evolution of helical domain reorientation in chiral magnets under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress.
- **Finding**: Helical phase reorientation under stress showed striking similarity to plastic deformation, where the propagation vector ($\mathbf{Q}$) reorientation was mediated by magnetic topological defects through "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes. Simulations suggest strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a key role. **In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** was the primary tool used to manipulate and directly observe these defect-mediated spin rearrangement processes under stress.

**16. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the emergence and control of Surface Spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) in chiral magnets, focusing on the role of the intrinsic phase factor $\phi_0$.
- **Finding**: Simulations demonstrated that the in-plane reorientation angle ($\phi_0$) controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of SSs at 1D FCIs. In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SSs were observed. Furthermore, SSs were found to form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films experimentally confirmed the formation of these SSs at skyrmion cluster facets via both thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation.

**17. [Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams to rationalize the nucleation and quenchability of metastable $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05841v1)**
- **Authors**: Akira Miura, Woohyeon Baek, Yuta Fujii, Kiyoharu Tadanaga, Rana Hossain, Aichi Yamashita, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Chikako Moriyoshi, Shintaro Kobayashi, Shogo Kawaguchi, Jiong Ding, Shigeo Mori, Atsushi Sakuda, Akitoshi Hayashi, Wenhao Sun
- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox of the metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ solid-state electrolyte by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: Density functional theory calculations revealed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization explains the ability to quench the metastable phase. This rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation were directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and **electron microscopy**.

**18. [Superconductivity onset above 60 K in ambient-pressure nickelate films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04708v1)**
- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity in epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) exceeding the previous 40 K limit.
- **Finding**: Superconductivity onset was achieved at $\sim 63$ K in films grown under compressive strain using an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime (Gigantic-oxidative Atomic-layer-by-layer Epitaxy, GAE). The enhanced superconductivity correlated with a systematic evolution of the normal-state resistivity, transitioning from Fermi-liquid-like ($\alpha \sim 2$) to strange-metal-like ($\alpha \sim 1$) behavior. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity of the films, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase.

**19. [Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04045v1)**
- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) pipeline for denoising low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images, suitable for in situ analysis and demonstrating robust out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.
- **Finding**: The proposed pipeline, utilizing a blind-spot convolution neural network, significantly outperformed other denoising methods, improving visual clarity of atomic features. The model achieved computational inference speeds in the order of milliseconds per image, making it fast enough for real-time in situ **HRTEM** experiments, and demonstrated excellent OOD generalization capabilities.

**20. [Resolving Structural Transitions in Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03881v1)**
- **Authors**: Billy E. Yang, Saeed S. I. Almishal, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Mary Kathleen Caucci, Gerald Bejger, Christina M. Rost, Nasim Alem, Susan B. Sinnott, Jon-Paul Maria
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2$-$\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and delineate the stability regions of bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: The study identified stability regions, showing that local bixbyite order persists up to $\sim 50\%$ Ce in equilibrium ceramics. Thin film studies demonstrated that kinetic energy can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase with only $20\%$ Ce, requiring a high oxygen vacancy concentration ($\sim 16.7\%$). **Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction** was essential in the comprehensive characterization package used to quantify crystal structure at multiple length-scales and identify phase boundaries invisible to X-ray diffraction.

**21. [Interfacial Control of Orbital Occupancy and Spin State in LaCoO$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03785v1)**
- **Authors**: Ellen M. Kiens, Nicolas Gauquelin, Arno Annys, Emma van der Minne, Iris C. G. van den Bosch, Matthijs A. van Spronsen, Zezhong Zhang, Annick de Backer, Sandra van Aert, Jo Verbeeck, Gertjan Koster, Bastian Mei, Frank M. F. de Groot, Christoph Baeumer
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy and spin state in $\text{LaCoO}_3$ through interfacial engineering with various perovskite oxide heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Interfacial charge transfer successfully tuned the Co orbital occupancy from partial $d^7$ (with $\text{LaTiO}_3$/$\text{LaMnO}_3$) to partial $d^5$ (with $\text{LaNiO}_3$). A $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer layer resulted in a $\text{Co}$ $d^6$ low spin state, demonstrating that the Co spin state is governed by the interfacial environment. **High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** imaging revealed a clear connection between the strain state at the oxide interfaces and the resulting spin configuration.

**22. [High Pressure and Compositionally Directed Route to a Hexagonal GeSn Alloy Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03602v1)**
- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize a new class of hexagonal $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions using high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis methods.
- **Finding**: By applying pressures of 9-10 GPa and temperatures up to 1500 K, novel hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H $\text{Ge-Sn}$ solid solutions ($\text{P}6_3/\text{mmc}$) were synthesized and recovered at ambient pressure. The hexagonal symmetry was accessible below 21 atom % Sn. **Precession electron diffraction** and **chemical analysis using electron microscopy** were crucial in confirming the recovered crystal symmetries and the composition of this new binary alloy landscape.

**23. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of instrumental parameters (convergence angle, defocus, and astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) in STEM.
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations demonstrated that defocus significantly underestimates the electrostatic field magnitude (e.g., up to $\sim 30\%$ for a 30 mrad probe). Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations exceeding $40\%$ for small field magnitudes. The study confirms the sensitivity of the DPC method and stresses the importance of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate Center of Mass (CoM) based **STEM** imaging.

- **Date**: 2025-12-01
- **Objective**: To report the in situ synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles inside silicon nitride nanopores, demonstrating reversible sealing and recovery of the pores.
- **Finding**: Iron oxide particles were synthesized inside nanopores (1.7 nm to 64.6 nm), resulting in rapid nanopore sealing ($\sim 1$ ms to $\sim 3.6$ s). The sealing process was shown to be reversible after cleaning. **Aberration-corrected scanning TEM (AC-STEM)** and **Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)** verified the synthesis and composition (mixed magnetite and maghemite) of the iron oxide nanoparticles within the membrane.

- **Date**: 2025-11-30
- **Objective**: To establish a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of monolayer graphene on various insulating perovskite oxide substrates using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
- **Finding**: Uniform, continuous monolayer graphene was successfully grown directly on $\text{SrTiO}_3$, $\text{LaAlO}_3$, and $(\text{La}_{0.18}\text{Sr}_{0.82})(\text{Al}_{0.59}\text{Ta}_{0.41})\text{O}_3$ substrates under the same optimal conditions. Characterization of the graphene/$\text{SrTiO}_3$ heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling. **Electron microscopy** (along with other techniques) confirmed the formation and uniformity of the monolayer graphene film.

Tănase, Aleksandra Miaskiewicz, Sebastian Weitz, Jing-Wen Hsueh, Mohamad-Assaad Mawass, Lucas de Souza Caldas, Suresh Manyarasu, Philippe Holzhey, Erik Wutke, Stepan Demchyshyn, Matthew R. Leyden, Angelika Harter, Roberto Felix Duarte, Jona Kurpiers, Philipp Wagner, Bernd Stannovski, Ljiljana Puskar, Roland Mainz, Daniel Abou-Ras, Thomas Schmidt, Lars Korte, Marcel Roß, Steve Albrecht
- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To improve the growth uniformity of co-evaporated perovskite films on textured silicon bottom cells using a $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer to achieve high-efficiency tandem solar cells.
- **Finding**: The $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer promotes organic precursor incorporation across the hole-transporting material/perovskite interface, preventing the formation of residual interfacial $\text{PbI}_2$ and leading to larger apparent grains. X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) revealed this homogenization effect, resulting in a certified perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell efficiency of $29.7\%$.

- **Authors**: Hiroshi Nakajima, Satoshi Hiroi, Hirofumi Tsukasaki, Yonghong Bing, Stéphane Grenier, Zuo-Guang Ye, Pierre-Eymeric Janolin, Shigeo Mori
- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the ferroelectric microstructures and dynamic domain behavior in chemically ordered ferroelectric $\text{Pb}(\text{Sc}_{1/2}\text{Nb}_{1/2})\text{O}_{3}$ (PSN).
- **Finding**: Intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains were discovered in ordered PSN, where electric polarization fluctuates around the [111] direction despite the long-range rhombohedral order, leading to unique weak relaxor properties. *In-situ* transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with dark-field imaging successfully revealed the dynamic behavior of domain-wall movements and paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence near the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition.

**28. [Scalable Synthesis of Large-Area $\text{WS}_2$ Thin Films from Tungsten Precursors by Thermal CVD and Their Application in Schottky-Barrier Solar Cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22063v1)**
- **Authors**: Jisun Kim, Yoosuk Kim, Seung-Ho Park, Yong Hun Ko, Chong-Yun Park
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: To develop a systematic thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy for synthesizing uniform, centimeter-scale $\text{WS}_2$ thin films from tungsten precursors and demonstrate their application in photovoltaic devices.
- **Finding**: Optimal sulfurization of sputtered W thin films at $800^\text{o}\text{C}$ yielded high-crystallinity, layered $\text{WS}_2$ with enhanced uniformity compared to films grown on W foils. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) collectively validated the stoichiometry and structural integrity of the synthesized films. Schottky-barrier solar cells fabricated from these films achieved a power conversion efficiency of $1.45\%$.

**29. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize a new class of crystalline interfaces, termed 'e-coherent,' where coherency is enhanced by local, non-affine relaxations, leading to the formation of unique line defects called discohesions.
- **Finding**: E-coherent interfaces achieve enhanced coherency through non-affine transformations, introducing discohesions—defects topologically equivalent to disconnection dipoles that cannot have long-range stress fields. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomistic simulations demonstrated that the energetics and kinetics of these interfaces are fundamentally governed by their discohesion content.

- **Finding**: By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in STEM, the $\text{Mn}-3\text{d}$ $\text{e}_{\text{g}}$ orbital polarization was directly visualized with sub-angstrom precision in strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_3$ thin films. This technique showed that compressive strain stabilizes $3\text{z}^2-\text{r}^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $\text{x}^2-\text{y}^2$, validating the approach for atomic-scale electronic anisotropy studies.

- **Authors**: Ana Senkić, Rachael Keneipp, Petra Ivatović, Namrata Pradeep, Vincent Meunier, Marko Kralj, Marija Drndić, Nataša Vujičić
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and characterize a structural phase transition induced by tungsten (W) doping in bilayer ($\text{2L}$) $\text{MoS}_2$ synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in anisotropic $\text{Fe}_{4-\text{x}}\text{Ge}_{\text{x}}\text{N}$ thin films and identify the origin of the observed two-component behavior.
- **Finding**: Tetragonal samples ($x=0.8$ and $1$) display two-component behavior in their transport effects, attributed to the coexistence of two crystallographic orientations (c-axis and a-axis normal to the film surface) and the opposite sign of the anomalous effects along these axes. Electron microscopy experiments confirmed the structural details, including the tetragonal distortion for $x>0.35$, which is critical for the observed anisotropy.

- **Objective**: To investigate how the substrate miscut angle affects the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting transition temperature ($\text{T}_{\text{c}}$) of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown $\text{NbN}$ films on c-plane sapphire.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle from $0.5^\text{o}$ to $10^\text{o}$ significantly improved the structural quality of the $\text{NbN}$ films, increasing $\text{T}_{\text{c}}$ marginally from $12.1\ \text{K}$ to $12.5\ \text{K}$. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images determined that the critical thickness for columnar growth is approximately $10\ \text{nm}$, independent of the substrate miscut.

- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism by which increasing V content in $\text{Nb-Ta-Ti-V}$ refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) induces a transition in the dominant dislocation glide mechanism, thereby enhancing high-temperature strength.
- **Finding**: Increased V content introduces substantial atomic misfit, raising the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This drives a gradual mechanistic transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used, alongside *in-situ* neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations, to confirm this change in deformation mechanism, which leads to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures.
