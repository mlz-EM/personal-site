- **Authors**: Yaozhu Li, Szilvia Kalácska, Phil McCausland, Roberta L. Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To analyze the multiscale microstructure of olivine in the Martian shergottite NWA 7721 to determine its pre-impact deformation history.
- **Finding**: The olivine exhibits a bimodal microstructure: fine, strain-free Type 1 subgrains (shock-induced recrystallization) and coarse, strongly strained Type 2 subgrains (preserving remnants of a highly deformed parent grain). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirmed the distinct orientation and strain characteristics of these populations, providing the first evidence that this olivine preserves dynamic crustal or magmatic stress experienced on Mars before impact.

**34. [Deep generative priors for robust and efficient electron ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07795v1)**
- **Authors**: Arthur R. C. McCray, Stephanie M. Ribet, Georgios Varnavides, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To introduce a deep generative prior (DGP) framework to improve the robustness, convergence speed, and efficiency of electron ptychography reconstruction, particularly for 3D multislice imaging.
- **Finding**: The DGP framework, which uses convolutional neural networks to parameterize the complex sample and probe, offers significant advantages over pixel-based reconstructions: greater noise robustness at low dose, markedly faster convergence, and improved depth regularization with minimal user-specified tuning. This establishes DGP-enabled ptychography as a robust approach for high-resolution electron microscopy imaging.

- **Authors**: Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland
- **Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the microscopic structure and local influence of regular stacking faults in the ferroelectric material $\text{Sr}_{2}\text{NaNb}_{5}\text{O}_{15}$.
- **Finding**: Stacking faults with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_{o}$ were found to annihilate in sets of four, resulting in four possible directions for the $S_{3}$ order parameter (related to $\text{NbO}_{6}$ octahedral tilts). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the fault structure, and calculations showed the faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes, suggesting they influence the material's ferroelectric properties.

**50. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part II - COMSOL Simulation and Apparatus Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03821v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of irregular crystallization in ZBLAN glass under vibration and redesign the experimental setup to ensure uniform thermal contact.
- **Finding**: FEM simulations confirmed that intermittent thermal contact caused by vibration reduces heat transfer. A redesigned apparatus ensured stable contact, demonstrating that higher vibration frequencies ($\sim 100~\mathrm{Hz}$) accelerate nucleation and reduce the effective fiber-drawing temperature window by $\sim 30~^{\circ}\text{C}$. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the formation of well-developed crystalline structures resulting from the vibration-enhanced nucleation.
