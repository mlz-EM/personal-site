**3. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties in $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{Fe}$) is varied, focusing on the influence of the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction revealed a percolation-driven transition in microstructure, changing from a continuous film to a percolative network when $t_{Fe}$ dropped below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This microstructural evolution, visualized by HRTEM, directly correlated with a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism, shifting from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism near the onset of structural and magnetic connectivity between grains.

**29. [Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $SrVO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843v1)**
- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a direct and controllable thermal reduction approach for recovering the intrinsic metallic character of the $\mathrm{SrVO}_{3}$ (SVO) surface by reducing the oxidized near-surface region (NSR).
- **Finding**: Thermal reduction under ultra-high vacuum causes a sharp transformation from a $\mathrm{V}^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states dominated by $\mathrm{V}^{4+}$, recovering metallic character. **High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM)**, combined with AFM and XRD, suggested that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and partial oxygen loss, leading to nanoscale surface reorganization rather than volatilization.

**46. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of varying $\mathrm{Pt}/\mathrm{Ru}$ ratios in electrodeposited overlays on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of $\mathrm{NiCoCrAlYTa}$ coatings.
