**1. [Understanding the oxidation of pure Tungsten in air and its impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22031v1)**
- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the oxidation of pure Tungsten (W) and the sublimation of W oxide to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
- **Finding**: Oxidation of W at 400-1050$^\circ$C revealed void and crack formation above 600$^\circ$C, leading to dust or oxide spalling. Electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy characterized the oxide scale as three main layers: an inner 30-50 nm thick WO$_2$ layer, a middle 10-20 $ \mu $m WO$_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer WO$_{2.9}$/WO$_3$ layer, with the observed microstructure discussed in relation to oxidation kinetics and tritium permeation.

**2. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To address the challenges of speckle noise in macroscale light-based synthetic aperture (SA) imaging and develop a method to overcome this limitation.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that speckle noise is a significant problem for light-based SA systems, proving that SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes is fundamentally impossible with sequential, per-measurement-independent speckle. A snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy were developed to overcome this, and simulations remarkably showed that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information, thereby improving the resolution of SA imaging systems.

- **Authors**: Robin Günkel, Oliver Maßmeyer, Markus Stein, Sebastian Anhäuser, Kalle Bräumer, Rodrigo Sandoval Rodriguez, Daniel Anders, Badrosadat Ojaghi Dogahe, Max Bergmann, Milan Solanki, Nils Fritjof Langlotz, Johannes Glowatzki, Jürgen Belz, Andreas Beyer, Gregor Witte, Sangam Chatterjee, Kerstin Volz
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the synthesis of 2D indium selenide (InSe) via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on c-plane sapphire substrates at low temperatures.
- **Finding**: A phase diagram covering In-rich, stoichiometric, and Se-rich In$_x$Se$_y$ phases was created by varying Se/In precursor ratio and growth temperature. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation of 2D InSe under optimized conditions. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy further revealed an epitaxial alignment of InSe with the sapphire substrate, mediated by a specific interface reconstruction, leading to material with high electron mobility.

**4. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of the large sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_2$.
- **Finding**: Single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices consistent with the expected $Immm$ structure, with no signs of uranium vacancies. However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the Te$_2$ layers, which are argued to give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters in SC-XRD data and are sufficient to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_2$.

**6. [Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17801v1)**
- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained 3D DNA origami nanostructures deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) consistently delivered the highest contrast for DNA origami, with optimal performance achieved at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate and palladium, which also largely retained structural integrity. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami, even for unstained samples, and provide practical guidelines for reliable structural visualization.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To directly measure the ultrafast dynamics and phase-space correlations of optical singularity ensembles.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities before annihilation, with measurements indicating velocities exceeding the speed of light, which are paradoxically amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes. These phenomena were demonstrated using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, enabling probing topological defect dynamics at unprecedented timescales.

- **Authors**: Jisheng Xie, Zhiheng Xie, Dijin Jiang, Shiyun Li, Yiheng Dai, Yao Zhang, Mufan Li, Jihan Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To develop a method for precisely tracking the three-dimensional (3D) atomic structural evolution of individual bimetallic nanocatalysts during electrocatalytic reactions.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, which directly tracks 3D atomic rearrangements in identical Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles throughout electrocatalytic cycles. They observed two stages of evolution: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, corroborated by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. This technique identified chemical short-range order at the atomic level and revealed anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations.

- **Authors**: Ernst Artes, Primiana Cavallo, Tobias Häger, Carl-Christian Meyer, Christoph Mokry, Dennis Renisch, Jörg Runke, Evgenia Schaffner, Alice Seibert, Christina Trautmann, Christoph E. Düllmann
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Objective**: To elucidate the possible influence of water and carbon dioxide concentrations in the plating solution on the quality of terbium and thulium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: The study found that water in the plating solution negatively affects the quality of thin films when its concentration exceeds 1 vol.-\%, and the presence of CO$_2$ leads to an increased carbonate content, which also negatively influences film quality. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to analyze the morphology of the thin films, revealing the detrimental impact of these contaminants on the film structure.

**10. [Melting point depression of charge density wave in 1T-TiSe$_2$ due to size effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16730v1)**
- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To investigate size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes, linking it to classical nucleation theory.
- **Finding**: Using in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperatures down to 20 K, the study observed a melting point depression of CDWs for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, a zero-temperature correlation length of 10-50 nm was estimated, matching reported CDW domain sizes. As flake size approached this correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length was cut off, limiting long-range order and lowering the transition temperature, with very small flakes showing an absence of CDWs, confirming classical nucleation theory for an electronic phase transition.

**11. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To address the systematic underestimation of porosity and pore size in nanoporous membranes observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) due to high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that increasing SEM acceleration voltage (from 1 kV to 10 kV) and Pt coating thickness (from 1.5 nm to 5 nm) significantly reduced measured porosity and pore size. A digital correction method simulating pore dilation was developed to estimate the pore structure of uncoated membranes, yielding porosity values up to 3-fold greater and mean pore diameters up to 2-fold greater than those observed with a 4 nm coating. These dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data, suggesting that true surface porosities and pore sizes are much larger than previously understood, with SEM corrections being crucial for accurate characterization.

- **Authors**: Kousuke Ooe, Yufan Shen, Kazuki Shitara, Shunsuke Kobayashi, Yuichi Shimakawa, Daisuke Kan, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To directly observe the polarization switching pathways by visualizing oxygen site dynamics in fluorite ferroelectrics using advanced atomic-column imaging.
- **Finding**: Using optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the researchers directly observed the polarization switching pathways by visualizing oxygen site dynamics in ZrO$_2$ and Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ freestanding membranes. They found that 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, the study also revealed how different cation species in fluorite oxides impact the accessible polarization switching pathways, providing atomic-level insights for advanced engineering of these materials.

- **Finding**: The study successfully demonstrated ghost imaging of complex patterns using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated in a transmission electron microscope, utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup. They achieved a spatial resolution down to 2 $ \mu $m, paving the way for adapting quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy platforms.

**14. [Characterization of superconducting germanide and germanosilicide films of Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir formed by solid-phase epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14173v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Li, Zhongxia Shang, Michael P. Lilly, Maksym Myronov, Leonid P. Rokhinson
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To conduct a comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir germanides, and to provide an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by solid-phase epitaxy.
- **Finding**: For films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, the study reported critical temperatures ($T_c$) of 3.4 K for IrGe and 2.6 K for IrSiGe. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface, providing crucial structural and compositional details for these superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices.

- **Authors**: Nikita Polin, Shangbin Shen, Fernando Maccari, Alex Aubert, Esmaeil Adabifiroozjaei, Tatiana Smoliarova, Yangyiwei Yang, Xinren Chen, Yurii Skourski, Alaukik Saxena, András Kovács, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Michael Farle, Bai-Xiang Xu, Leopoldo Molina-Luna, Oliver Gutfleisch, Baptiste Gault, Konstantin Skokov
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanism of high coercivity in Ce(Co$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_5$ permanent magnets.
- **Finding**: Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), the study identified a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition in Ce(Co$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)$_{5.4}$ magnets. This structure consisted of Cu-poor cylindrical cells (5-10 nm diameter, ~20 nm long) with a disordered CeCo$_5$-type structure and Cu-rich cell boundaries (~5 nm thick) exhibiting a modified CeCo$_5$ structure. Micromagnetic simulations, informed by these microstructural observations, demonstrated that intrinsic Cu concentration gradients up to 12 at.% Cu/nm lead to spatial variations in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity.

**16. [Morphological and Chemical Changes in Cd-free Colloidal QD-LEDs During Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12597v1)**
- **Authors**: Ruiqi Zhang, Jamie Geng, Shaun Tan, Shreyas Srinivasan, Taehyung Kim, Mayuran Saravanapavanantham, Kwang-Hee Lim, Mike Dillender, Heejae Chung, Thienan Nguyen, Karen Yang, Yongli Lu, Taegon Kim, Moungi G. Bawendi, Vladimir Bulovic
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To understand the underlying degradation mechanisms and improve the operational lifetimes of Cd-free colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs).
- **Finding**: The study observed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer (ETL) and QD emissive layer of InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs during operation, accompanied by the generation and diffusion of oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals. In situ transmission electron microscopy revealed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerated ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. Acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilized the ETL/QD layers by suppressing radical formation and morphology changes, leading to dramatic lifetime enhancements (8-fold and 5000-fold for red- and blue-emitting QD-LEDs, respectively).

- **Authors**: Vijay Kumar, Kaitlyn M. Mullin, Hyunggon Park, Matthew Gerigk, Andrew Bresk, Tresa M. Pollock, Yangying Zhu
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To develop an integrated experimental-computational approach for accurately resolving extreme and transient thermal conditions during selective laser melting (SLM) and predicting microstructure evolution.
- **Finding**: A unique approach coupling high-speed infrared imaging during SLM of MAR-M247 with a transient three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics simulation was demonstrated to reconstruct the dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool. This framework enabled the estimation of experimentally-validated, 3D solidification conditions. Ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps were used to validate predictions of variations in microstructure size and orientation driven by laser processing parameters, substantiating the importance of this integrated approach for in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in commercial additive manufacturing.

**18. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v2)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To quantitatively compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and ptychography phase imaging, particularly for beam-sensitive materials, using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The study applied detective quantum efficiency (DQE) as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance in electron microscopy. It was found that for a weak-phase object, ptychography cannot achieve the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope, but it demonstrates greater robustness to partial coherence, providing a quantitative framework for evaluating and comparing these advanced electron microscopy techniques.

**19. [Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO2(100) Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11568v1)**
- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To understand and control the atomic structure of the polar CeO$_2$(100) surface to unravel surface reactivity and design advanced catalytic materials.
- **Finding**: An integrated approach combining global structure search, machine learning potentials, DFT calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) discovered a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO$_2$(100) surface. This reconstruction, characterized by alternating Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms, is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable. Crucially, the formation of localized Ce$^{3+}$ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, activating these states, enhancing electron-donating capacity, and facilitating the dissociation of adsorbed molecules like H$_2$O.

- **Authors**: Yonghao Weng, Liqiang Gao, Linwu Zhu, Jian Huang
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for systematically validating the capabilities of AI models in the specialized field of materials characterization and analysis.
- **Finding**: MatQnA was developed, encompassing ten mainstream characterization methods, including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), with high-quality question-answer pairs generated using a hybrid LLM and human-in-the-loop approach. Preliminary evaluations showed that advanced multi-modal AI models achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis.

- **Authors**: Yuqing Xing, Hui Chen, Li Huang, Roger Guzman, Qi Zheng, Senhao Lv, Jinan Shi, Haitao Yang, Wu Zhou, Hong-Jun Gao
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To uncover and characterize intrinsic quantum clusters (localized point defects) on the surface of the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ and understand their role in shaping quantum states.
- **Finding**: The study uncovered intrinsic quantum clusters, identified as native oxygen defects, on the surface of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy. These clusters act as tunable quantum perturbations, reshaping electronic states and order parameters. Oxygen impurities on the Sn-terminated surface tune the flat band near the Fermi level, exhibiting an unconventional Zeeman effect, while on the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials generate occupied impurity states with varying symmetries and no measurable magnetic response.

**22. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study found that ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position, demonstrating inherent resilience to trajectory-induced artifacts. In contrast, atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Furthermore, spiral scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO$_3$ thin films improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions, establishing practical guidelines for programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM.

- **Authors**: Debarghya Mallick, Sujoy Ghosh, An Hsi Chen, Qiangsheng Lu, Liam Collins, Sangsoo Kim, Gyula Eres, Ivan Kravchenko, Stephen Jesse, Steven J. Randolph, Scott T. Retterer, Matthew Brahlek, Robert G. Moore
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate an all-in-plane method for fabricating superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak link junctions in FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ (FTS/BT) thin films using focused Si$^{++}$ ion beams (FIB).
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully "nanosculpted" ~100 nm-wide channels into FTS/BT thin films using FIB, demonstrating that increasing the ion dose progressively suppresses both the critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$), confirming the creation of a controllable weak link. Kelvin probe force microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy corroborated the structural and electronic modifications of the irradiated region. $I_c(B)$ measurements revealed that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion and associated dissipation, offering a scalable pathway to Josephson junction fabrication.

**24. [Field-induced reversible phase transition and negative differential resistance in In2Se3 ferroelectric semiconducting FETs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09233v1)**
- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To investigate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable NDR with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ FeS-FETs. Combining high-resolution electron microscopy with electrical transport measurements, the NDR was attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $ \alpha $-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging revealed that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moire patterns), and intralayer shear, together producing stress-induced phase transitions, while out-of-plane fields resulted in robust non-volatile polarization switching.

**25. [Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497v1)**
- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: To study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS$_2$) nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and explain recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations.
- **Finding**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations observed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes as the nanoparticle edges were approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained this phenomenon by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need for full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. The study also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials to accurately extrapolate DFT calculations to larger systems.

**26. [Comparing Machine Learning and Physics-Based Nanoparticle Geometry Determinations Using Far-Field Spectral Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08174v1)**
-   **Authors**: Mengqi Sun, Zixu Huang, Muammer Y. Yaman, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin, David S. Ginger
-   **Date**: 2025-09-09
-   **Objective**: To compare machine learning (variational autoencoders) and physics-based methods for determining the geometries of gold nanorods (orientation and aspect ratio) using far-field optical scattering spectra.
-   **Finding**: A dual-branch multimodal variational autoencoder (VAE), trained on paired dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images, successfully predicted Au nanorod geometries (orientational angle and aspect ratio) using only spectral input. Electron microscopy images were crucial for providing ground truth geometry data during VAE training, enabling the model to learn a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology. The VAE's performance was comparable to physics-based fitting, even with a small training set, demonstrating a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-09
-   **Objective**: To demonstrate the tunable synthesis of 1T$'$ and 1T phases of CrS$_2$ and Cr$_2$S$_3$ via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterize their structural and magnetic properties.
-   **Finding**: The researchers successfully synthesized a previously unreported 1T$'$ crystal phase of CrS$_2$ and achieved tunable synthesis of either 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ or 1T CrS$_2$ via MOCVD. 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction was critical for identifying these phases and revealing that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation from 1T, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure. The 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperatures, paving the way for scalable synthesis of 2D magnets.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To directly resolve the atomic-scale mechanisms of the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition pathway in PbZrO$_3$ thin films under applied electric fields using operando electron microscopy.
-   **Finding**: Operando scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with electric field biasing directly resolved a multi-step antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in PbZrO$_3$ thin films, involving several metastable phases. Atomic-resolution imaging and complementary nano-beam electron diffraction provided critical insights into how this pathway and its end states can be modulated, including the formation of a "dead layer" near the substrate. This work highlights the crucial role of local energetics in phase stability and provides key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions.

-   **Finding**: The researchers successfully solved the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy using multislice electron ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation. This electron microscopy technique allowed for the individual visualization of each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies (exclusively in outer Se planes). MEP also uncovered a new type of structural disorder involving mixed bending- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations, demonstrating its power for generating 3D atom-by-atom models of 2D heterointerfaces.

-   **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
-   **Date**: 2025-09-08
-   **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior, specifically the hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
-   **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging resulted in brittle fracture within the elastic regime of the DP steel. Fractographic studies, combined with site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations, revealed intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology at crack initiation, with sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. TEM and transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies further identified $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking in the predominant brittle fracture region, explaining the HE via a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocities.

-   **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
-   **Date**: 2025-09-07
-   **Objective**: To understand how dopants self-organize within amorphous interfacial complexions in multi-component nanocrystalline alloys and how this chemical patterning alters local structural short-range order.
-   **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and elemental analysis revealed chemical partitioning at both grain and interphase boundaries in Cu-rich nanocrystalline alloys, with specific dopant enrichment/depletion at the amorphous-crystalline transition region. While nanobeam electron diffraction provided qualitative measures of short-range order, atomistic simulations, informed by these EM observations, demonstrated that increased grain boundary chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure, driven by segregation to the transition regions. This work highlights the intimate connection between local chemistry and structural order in amorphous interfacial complexions.

While this paper focuses on X-ray microscopy, the principle of identifying imaging conditions is analogous to challenges in electron microscopy. The automated identification transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool, making statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials more accessible by overcoming the bottleneck of manual classification.

High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were crucial for characterizing defects (stacking faults, dislocations) and associated chemical fluctuations, demonstrating that elemental segregation reduces the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies. This segregation-driven cross-slip, along with local stress concentrations, enhances the alloy's high-temperature deformation resistance.
