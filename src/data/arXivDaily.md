**1. [Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02234v1)**
- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate how substrate morphology can be used to control and reverse the strain state in V$_2$O$_3$ thin films, thereby tuning their phase transitions.
- **Finding**: The study found that minute changes in substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped) can relax compressive strain, allowing thermally-induced tensile strain to dominate, leading to significant differences in film resistivity and phase stability. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) was crucial for elucidating the strain relaxation mechanism by imaging atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in the V$_2$O$_3$.

**2. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how aberration-corrected bright-field (acBF) imaging, combining tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC), can improve dose-efficient 4D-STEM imaging by enabling continuously non-zero contrast transfer even with higher-order aberrations.
- **Finding**: The research shows that acBF imaging, by combining tcBF and tcDPC, maintains continuously non-zero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. This is achieved by the probe-forming lens's phase shift at Scherzer defocus, which acts as a phase plate to remove oscillations from the acBF CTF, with its superior performance demonstrated on both simulated and experimental 4D-STEM data.

- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that reliable and successful image reconstructions are achievable in simulated 2D position-blind ptychography, even with measurement noise, provided there is the right illumination structure and a strong prior (score-based diffusion models). While not directly electron microscopy, ptychography is a key technique in advanced electron microscopy, and this work explores fundamental limits and solutions for a challenging variant of the problem relevant to future imaging capabilities.

Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling observed in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers, to determine if it is evidence for altermagnetic ordering in RuO$_2$ thin films.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that the observed exchange bias behavior in RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers is not due to altermagnetic ordering in RuO$_2$, but rather driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer, specifically Fe$_3$O$_4$, which undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the interfacial structure, complementing other techniques and providing crucial evidence for the chemical disorder at the interface.

**13. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy that can overcome the limitations of speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging.
- **Finding**: The research demonstrates that speckle noise fundamentally impedes sequential SA imaging of diffuse scenes but can be overcome by a novel snapshot SA imaging method. Remarkably, simulations show that speckle can even be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, effectively improving resolution. While not directly electron microscopy, the principles of synthetic aperture imaging and phase retrieval are broadly relevant to advanced imaging techniques, including those in electron microscopy.

- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To observe and quantify the size-dependent nucleation and melting point depression of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes.
- **Finding**: The research directly observed a melting point depression of CDWs in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm, consistent with classical nucleation theory. In-situ cryogenic electron microscopy, with temperature control down to 20 K, was essential for observing these size-dependent effects, revealing that as flake size approaches the CDW correlation length (estimated at 10-50 nm), long-range order is limited, lowering the transition temperature and even leading to the absence of CDWs in very small flakes.

- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To understand the atomic structure and reactivity of the polar CeO$_2$(100) surface, particularly its reconstruction behavior, which is crucial for heterogeneous catalysis.

In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was critical in confirming this reconstructed surface, which is characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. This reconstruction leads to orbital hybridization between Ce $4f$ and O $2p$ states, activating O $2p$ states and enhancing electron-donating capacity, thereby facilitating the dissociation of adsorbed molecules.
