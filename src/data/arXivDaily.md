**34. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on the structural and electronic properties, and ultimately superconductivity, in bilayer nickelates La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.
- **Finding**: The study found that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers, which suppresses superconductivity. **Multislice electron ptychography** and **electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)** were instrumental in investigating the structural and electronic properties at the atomic scale, allowing for the direct visualization of Pr dopant locations and the identification of the striped interstitial oxygen order, providing key insights into the competition between this order and superconductivity.

- **Authors**: Mingyu Liu, Zian Mao, Zhu Liu, Haoran Zhang, Jintao Guo, Xiaoya He, Xi Huang, Shufen Chu, Chun Cheng, Jun Ding, Yujun Xie
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To develop an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline, 4D-PreNet, for preprocessing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to address pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions.
- **Finding**: 4D-PreNet, integrating attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures, simultaneously performs denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration on 4D-STEM diffraction patterns. The network, trained on large simulated datasets, generalizes effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. **Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)** data is the target for this framework, and the quantitative evaluations demonstrated significant improvements in noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns (up to 50% MSE reduction in denoising, sub-pixel center localization), thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

**36. [Experimental evidence of disordered crystalline premixing in sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01484v1)**
- **Authors**: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: To directly measure the premixed phase at the interfaces of sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which are known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions.
- **Finding**: The study provides direct experimental evidence of a disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers, contradicting previously reported a priori predictions of an amorphous interlayer. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** was the primary technique used for this direct measurement, allowing for atomic-scale imaging and characterization of the interface. This observation of a crystalline premix, which retains its symmetry after annealing but shows lattice parameter shifts consistent with an Al-rich composition, is attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.

**37. [Multiscale Microscopy via Automation: Dual Magnification ESEM Imaging by Frame Alternation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06523v1)**
- **Authors**: Maurits Vuijk, Johannes Zeininger, Luis Sandoval, Günther Rupprechter, Beatriz Roldan Cuenya, Karsten Reuter, Thomas Lunkenbein, Christoph Scheurer
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Objective**: To develop and implement an automation interface for Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) to enable dual-magnification imaging by frame alternation, allowing simultaneous acquisition of data at different length scales.
- **Finding**: The custom-designed automation interface successfully minimized human supervision and allowed for the collection of multiple interlaced datasets simultaneously. By changing acquisition settings after each frame, the system captured alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location. **Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM)** was the core technique, and this dual-magnification method enabled the acquisition of both low-magnification overviews of mesoscopic surface dynamics and high-magnification views of ongoing structural changes of selected surface motifs. This truly correlative data facilitates establishing cross-scale correlations, including phase information, in catalytic systems like hydrogen oxidation over Co foil.

- **Date**: 2025-07-31
- **Objective**: To explore the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings, specifically to probe their efficiency and morphology through conical diffraction and diffuse scattering.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that in grazing incidence geometry, synchrotron measurements can simultaneously capture conical diffraction and diffuse scattering patterns, which are sensitive to the blazed gratings' structure. The diffraction component is sensitive to the average groove profile, while diffuse scattering depends on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface. These findings were supported by numerical simulations and validated using data from **atomic force microscopy (AFM)** and **scanning electron microscopy (SEM)**. SEM provided crucial morphological information about the gratings, complementing the synchrotron data and simulations to characterize modern optical elements.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals to understand the presence of topological spin textures in a centrosymmetric material and clarify its magnetic ground state.
- **Finding**: The study revealed, through **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** techniques, that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking despite maintaining global inversion symmetry as per X-ray diffraction. This structural analysis, coupled with the observation of Néel skyrmions via **Lorentz-TEM**, provides a convincing explanation for their presence in centrosymmetric materials. Furthermore, magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction studies indicated a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, not a glassy magnetic state, with a clear correlation between skyrmion density hysteresis and magnetization, suggesting that topological spin textures are affected by the development of ferrimagnetism. **Magnetic force microscopy (MFM)** observed magnetic bubbles at the phase boundary, supporting skyrmion stabilization by competing magnetic phases.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To develop a high-throughput spectro-ptychography methodology to visualize local Ni oxidation state behavior in single-crystal NMC811 cathodes with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, serving as a proxy for state-of-charge and understanding chemical degradation pathways.
- **Finding**: A high-throughput data collection strategy enabled 2D and 3D ptychography to be performed in minutes, combined with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), to map local Ni oxidation states in SC-NMC811 with nanometer resolution. This **electron microscopy-based spectro-ptychography** technique allowed direct mapping of chemical degradation along Li channels, identification of nucleation sites, and observation of Ni oxidation state heterogeneities across electrode and particle scales at various stages of lifetime cycling. These heterogeneities were correlated with the formation and growth of the rocksalt phase and oxygen-induced planar gliding, advancing the fundamental understanding of high-Ni layered oxide material degradation.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To realize Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) nanowaveguides and experimentally observe second harmonic generation (SHG) in these structures, demonstrating their potential for integrated nonlinear photonics.
- **Finding**: ZnS thin films were successfully deposited via RF magnetron sputtering, and their properties were characterized using various techniques. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** was employed to characterize the morphology of the deposited ZnS thin films and the fabricated nanowaveguides, confirming their structural integrity and dimensions. This structural characterization, alongside atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ellipsometry, was crucial for understanding the material properties that led to the experimental observation of SHG in the nanowaveguides, establishing ZnS as a promising platform for compact and integrated frequency conversion devices.

- **Authors**: Naresh Prajapati, Manoj Kumar, Vidit Pandey, Sandeep Munjal, Himanshu Pandey
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize cobalt ferrite (CoFe$_2$O$_4$) nanoparticles for use as a recoverable photocatalyst in white LED-based treatment of organic dye contaminants in water.
- **Finding**: Cobalt ferrite (CoFe$_2$O$_4$) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using the sol-gel method and annealed at 500$^\circ$C. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** was utilized for structural analysis, providing insights into the morphology and size of the synthesized nanoparticles. This characterization, along with X-ray diffraction, Raman, and Infrared spectroscopy, confirmed the material's structure, which is critical for its semiconducting behavior and narrow optical bandgap. The nanoparticles demonstrated high photocatalytic activity, decomposing 95% of methyl orange and methylene blue dyes under white LED irradiation within 150 minutes, with further improvement upon H$_2$O$_2$ addition.

**43. [Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism to understand how information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data and identify new imaging modes.
- **Finding**: The study shows that tilt correction and summation of symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk (tcBF and tcDPC) enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF), maximizing 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond WPOA, contrast transfer from inelastic/plural scattering electrons (quadratic terms) is identified, showing enhanced contrast at selected frequencies under overfocus conditions. **Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)** is the central technique, and the framework demonstrates how to construct a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) from the dark field region, summing incoherent scattering components for potential depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This work generalizes phase contrast theory to 4D-STEM, providing analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography.

Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during processing, using X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that pressing SCNCs into bulk pellets distorts the fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Heat treatment, applied for organic crosslinking, significantly affects planar defects. **In-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**, combined with X-ray analyses, was crucial for directly observing the migration and healing of stacking faults and structural changes at inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries at the tens of nanometer scale. These observations, further supported by molecular dynamics simulations, provide new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles and their remarkable mechanical properties.

- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To directly image the real-time formation dynamics of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation.
- **Finding**: The study observed a rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state, and short-lived DWs that spontaneously vanish within picoseconds in a narrow fluence window. **Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy** was the key technique, enabling direct, real-time imaging of these femtosecond-scale dynamics of magnetic domain walls. Multiscale simulations, combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics, revealed a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs, explaining the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering.

**46. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware metric for assessing the practical performance of phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), moving beyond the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that the CTF often overestimates practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. By using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, it was shown that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs with analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography showed a surprising dose dependence: its SSNR converges to direct ptychography at low fluence and saturates at a value consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds at high fluence. This work highlights the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and establishes SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** phase retrieval methods.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop an approach combining structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation, specifically to probe magnetic dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ ions.
- **Finding**: The researchers generated spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses optimized for selective excitation of magnetic and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. While the primary technique is optical spectroscopy, the "tailored sample morphology" and "nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna" imply the need for precise fabrication and characterization at the nanoscale. Although not explicitly stated, **electron microscopy techniques** would be essential for verifying the morphology, dimensions, and integration of these nanostructures and metallic antennas, which are critical for achieving the observed 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of magnetic dipole transitions with azimuthally polarized beams. This setup provides new opportunities for spectroscopy of forbidden transitions.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the dipole organization within irreducibly narrow polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films to understand the formation of atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180 degree domain walls.
- **Finding**: The study revealed, through **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** of an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film in plan-view orientation, that dipole organization within these narrow polar layers is strikingly non-uniform. It forms atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180 degree domain walls, at most a few unit cells long, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations. STEM was critical for observing these smallest reported domains (sub-nm$^2$ footprint) in a polar material and for revealing their distinctive interfacial structures. This work represents the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls nested within self-organized polar-nonpolar layering, uncovering a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale.

- **Objective**: To overcome the limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy to precisely determine the atomic-scale distribution of hydrogen in metal hydrides, which is crucial for understanding its role in material properties.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes challenges related to hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility by offering exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. **Multislice electron ptychography (MEP)** was the transformative method, experimentally resolving heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantifying hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work establishes MEP as a powerful tool for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.

- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography to relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements traditionally limiting the resolution of direct ptychography in electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study formulates parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, using this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography and relax its traditional Nyquist sampling requirements. This allows for optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques, even with larger probe step sizes. **Electron microscopy** is the underlying technique for both direct ptychography and parallax imaging, and the analytical results were demonstrated numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions, showing how this approach can improve achievable resolution and dose efficiency in phase retrieval.
