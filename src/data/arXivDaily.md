- **Authors**: Ruiqi Zhang, Jamie Geng, Shaun Tan, Shreyas Srinivasan, Taehyung Kim, Mayuran Saravanapavanantham, Kwang-Hee Lim, Mike Dillender, Heejae Chung, Thienan Nguyen, Karen Yang, Yongli Lu, Taegon Kim, Moungi G. Bawendi, Vladimir Bulovic
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To understand the underlying degradation mechanisms in heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) during operation.
- **Finding**: The study revealed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer, QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer of Cd-free QD-LEDs during operation. **In situ transmission electron microscopy** showed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. These morphological changes were accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals throughout the device. Acrylate-based resin-encapsulation significantly improved device stability by suppressing radical formation and morphology changes.

**3. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v1)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron ptychography for imaging beam-sensitive materials using detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The study applied the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance. They found that for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope, but that ptychography is more robust to partial coherence. This provides a new metric for evaluating and comparing the performance of different electron imaging techniques, especially for dose-sensitive applications.

- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To understand the reconstruction behavior and surface reactivity of the polar CeO$_2$(100) surface.
- **Finding**: A previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO$_2$(100) surface was discovered through an integrated approach combining global structure search, machine learning potentials, DFT, and **in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**. The reconstructed surface, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ ions and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms, was found to be both thermodynamically and kinetically stable. The formation of localized Ce$^{3+}$ polarons and their strong hybridization with surface O 2p orbitals enhanced electron-donating capacity and facilitated H$_2$O dissociation, revealing a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism for tuning catalytic performance.

- **Finding**: The study uncovered intrinsic quantum clusters, identified as native oxygen defects, on the surface of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ via **scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy** and **non-contact atomic force microscopy**, combined with **scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy**. These clusters act as tunable quantum perturbations, reshaping electronic states and order parameters. On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities tune the flat band near the Fermi level, exhibiting an unconventional Zeeman effect. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials generate occupied impurity states with reduced symmetry, but no measurable magnetic response.

**7. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam scanning trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that programmable electron-beam scanning offers opportunities to improve dose efficiency and suppress scan-induced artifacts in **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**. Using DyScO$_3$ and BaTiO$_3$ as model systems, ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and were robust to large jumps in probe position. In contrast, atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Spiral scanning under cryogenic conditions improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions, establishing practical guidelines for low-dose 4D-STEM.

- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate an all-in-plane method for fabricating superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak links by "nanosculpting" channels in FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films using a focused ion beam.
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully created ~100 nm-wide channels in FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films using a Si$^{++}$ **focused ion beam (FIB)**, systematically suppressing critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$) to form controllable weak links. **Kelvin probe force microscopy**, **atomic force microscopy**, and **scanning electron microscopy** corroborated the structural and electronic modifications in the irradiated regions. The study also found that irradiation-induced defects acted as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion. This FIB patterning offers a simple and scalable pathway for fabricating Josephson junctions and engineering robust qubits.

- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To investigate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and understand the underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ FeS-FETs. Combining **high-resolution electron microscopy** with electrical transport measurements, the NDR was attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale **ex-situ imaging** revealed that in-plane electric fields ($V_d$) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moire patterns), and intralayer shear, leading to stress-induced phase transitions, while out-of-plane fields resulted in robust non-volatile polarization switching.

**10. [Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497v1)**
- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: To study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS$_2$) nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and explain experimental observations of enhanced vibrations at edges.
- **Finding**: Molecular Dynamics simulations showed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes at the edges of MoS$_2$ nanoparticles, consistent with recent experimental **High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM)** observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained this by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge. The study also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials, enabling accurate extrapolations of DFT calculations to larger systems for HR-TEM image interpretation.

- **Date**: 2025-09-09
- **Objective**: To compare machine learning (variational autoencoders) and physics-based methods for determining the geometries (orientation and aspect ratio) of gold nanorods using far-field polarized dark-field scattering spectra.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated the use of dual-branch multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict gold nanorod geometries (orientational angle and aspect ratio) from polarized dark-field scattering spectra. By training on paired spectra-image data, the VAE achieved comparable performance to physics-based fitting methods, even with a small training set. **Electron microscopy images** were used as ground truth for training and validation of the VAE, enabling the model to generate nanorod images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio from spectra-only input.

Phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and **4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction**. The 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperatures. **4DSTEM** characterization revealed a complex transformation process from 1T to 1T$'$, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals, paving the way for scalable synthesis of 2D magnets.

- **Finding**: The study employed **operando scanning transmission electron microscopy** electric field biasing to directly resolve the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in PbZrO$_3$ thin films. **Atomic-resolution imaging** revealed a multi-step transition involving several metastable phases. Complementary **nano-beam electron diffraction** and atomic scale analysis showed that this pathway and its end states could be modulated, leading to the formation of a "dead layer" with suppressed switching behavior. Dynamic phase transformations were observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases, driven by competing internal and external fields, providing key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions.

- **Authors**: Jeffrey Huang, Yichao Zhang, Sang hyun Bae, Ballal Ahammed, Elif Ertekin, Pinshane Y. Huang
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To experimentally access and map out-of-plane deformations, defects, and moiré corrugations in 2D moiré materials with picometer-scale accuracy.
- **Finding**: The researchers solved the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy using **multislice electron ptychography (MEP)** acquired from a single orientation. The resulting atomic models individually visualized each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in the interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies (exclusively in the outer Se planes). A new, unexpected type of structural disorder, consisting of mixed bending- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations, was also observed. This method generates 3D atom-by-atom models from data acquired in about 30 seconds, enabling routine access to 3D atomic information in 2D systems.

- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and underlying mechanisms in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: The study investigated hydrogen embrittlement in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel, observing brittle fracture at 900 MPa within the elastic regime after hydrogen pre-charging. Fractographic studies revealed intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology at crack initiation. **Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** investigations showed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and later, predominant brittle fracture with $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking. **Transmission Kikuchi diffraction** and **electron backscatter diffraction** studies on cross-sectional cracks supported a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to crack tips promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocities.

- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: To understand how dopants self-organize within amorphous interfacial complexions in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys and how this chemical patterning alters local structural short-range order.
- **Finding**: The study investigated local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich nanocrystalline alloys. **High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy** and elemental analysis revealed chemical partitioning at both grain and interphase boundaries, with the amorphous-crystalline transition region showing enrichment in certain dopant species and depletion of others. Atomistic simulations, using a custom machine learning interatomic potential, demonstrated that increased grain boundary chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to transition regions driving changes in local structure sensitive to dopant ratios.

- **Date**: 2025-09-05
- **Objective**: To automate the reliable identification of weak- versus strong-beam conditions in dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) for quantitative characterization of dislocations.
- **Finding**: The researchers introduced a deep learning framework using a lightweight convolutional neural network trained on small, hand-labeled datasets to automate the identification of weak-beam conditions in dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This addresses a critical bottleneck in DFXM, which is the manual and subjective classification of imaging conditions that enhance dislocation contrast. This automated approach transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool for statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials, enabling more robust, rapid, and scalable analysis.

- **Finding**: The study presented a simplified fabrication method for all-polymer metasurfaces by repurposing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the resonator material, eliminating complex multi-step procedures. A bilayer recipe enabled the convenient fabrication of freestanding membranes with high quality nanopatterns. The suspended membrane was examined with **scanning electron microscopy** to confirm its structural integrity. **Atomic force microscopy** was used for nanoindentation experiments to extract position-dependent spring constants and pretension. These all-polymer metasurfaces experimentally delivered high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, despite the low refractive index of the polymer.

- **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
- **Date**: 2025-08-31
- **Objective**: To apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in phase-change materials (PCMs) like Ge-Sb-Te alloys.
- **Finding**: The study developed a protocol for clustering **4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)** data to differentiate phases in glasses. By applying unsupervised machine learning (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, k-means clustering) to Ge-Sb-Te alloys, four distinct clusters were identified, revealing nanoscale compositional and structural heterogeneity. Elemental intensity histograms showed chemical signatures (oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4) across clusters, and averaged diffraction patterns confirmed structural variations. This demonstrates a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs using advanced electron microscopy and data analysis.

- **Authors**: Tomoya Nakatani, Nattamon Suwannaharn, Taisuke Sasaki
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the structure and anisotropic electrical resistivity of single-crystalline CoSn kagome metal thin films for potential interconnect applications.
- **Finding**: The researchers fabricated single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) thin films via magnetron sputtering and investigated their anisotropic electrical resistivity. The films exhibited low resistivity ($\rho$) along the $[0001]$ direction (c-axis) and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of $\rho$ between $[0001]$ and $[2\bar{1}\bar{1}0]$ (a-axis), consistent with bulk CoSn. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy** revealed the growth of CoSn(10-10) single-crystals with $(11\bar{2}0)$ and $(01\bar{1}0)$ side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films. These structural details, particularly the pronounced surface roughness attributed to 3D crystal growth, highlighted both the potential and challenges of using CoSn kagome metal in future interconnect technologies.

In-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED) confirmed optimal structural properties at a high substrate growth temperature. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy** provided evidence of pits at the interface, most probably due to GaN thermal decomposition. In-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy revealed core level shifts consistent with electron transfer from n-GaN(0001) to 2H-TaS$_2$ and the formation of nitrogen vacancies near the interface, but no chemical reaction, corroborating the potential for integrating 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with 3D semiconducting GaN.
