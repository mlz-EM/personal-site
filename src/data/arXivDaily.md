- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Objective**: To control the growth of highly textured Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films on SrTiO$_3$ substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and investigate the impact of growth parameters on film properties.

- **Authors**: Samanta Pal, Kaustuv Chatterjee, A. K. Raychaudhuri, Prabir Pal
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To investigate the charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayer and multilayer 1T-VS$_2$ at room temperature and understand their evolution.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) revealed a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R$19.1^\circ$ in monolayer 1T-VS$_2$ at room temperature. With increasing layers, the CDW order evolved into a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure.

- **Authors**: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: To conduct an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation and the short-to-long crack transition in a ductile 5052 aluminium alloy.
- **Finding**: In-situ scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) revealed that microstructure-sensitive short cracks in cold-worked 5052 aluminium alloy propagate in a quasi-brittle manner at low energy release rates. A transition to plasticity-dominated crack arrest occurs when the crack's process zone becomes large enough to induce plastic deformation and blunt the crack, establishing that the short-to-long crack transition is governed by the process zone rather than crack length.

- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate how substrate morphology can be used to control and reverse the strain state in V$_2$O$_3$ Mott insulator thin films, thereby tuning their phase transitions.
- **Finding**: Minute changes in sapphire substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped, achieved by annealing) were found to reverse the dominant strain in V$_2$O$_3$ films from compressive (lattice mismatch-induced) to tensile (thermal expansion mismatch-induced). This control over strain resulted in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases across all temperatures, leading to orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) elucidated the strain relaxation mechanism by imaging atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in V$_2$O$_3$, offering a novel pathway to tune strain in thin films.

- **Authors**: Chih-Yu Lee, Yi-Siou Huang, Felix Adams, Chuanyu Lian, Hongyi Sun, Jie Zhao, Zichao Ye, Nathan Youngblood, Juejun Hu, Leslie H Allen, Yifei Mo, Ichiro Takeuchi, Carlos A Rios Ocampo
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of Si doping on the optical properties, crystal structure, and phase change characteristics of Sb$_2$Se$_3$ to tailor it as an optical phase change material (OPCM).
- **Finding**: Incorporating 20% Si into Sb$_2$Se$_3$ films via magnetron co-sputtering significantly increased the transparency window in both amorphous and crystalline states, extending to 800 nm (1.55 eV) in the amorphous phase, and reduced power consumption by lowering the melting temperature. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM), along with other characterization techniques, were used to investigate the structural effects of Si doping. However, this came at the cost of reduced refractive index contrast and slower phase transition kinetics, highlighting a trade-off in material properties.

**50. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how aberrations, particularly spherical aberration at Scherzer defocus, can be leveraged to improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging.
- **Finding**: This paper shows that aberration-corrected bright-field (acBF) imaging, which combines tilt-corrected bright-field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC) images, enables continuously non-zero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations in 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the probe-forming lens's phase shift acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF contrast transfer function (CTF), leading to superior performance compared to tcBF or DPC methods alone, as demonstrated on both simulated and experimental data.
