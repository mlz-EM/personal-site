- **Finding**: The study reported the successful growth of up to 180 nm thick $(111)$-oriented FeO heteroepitaxial films on slightly lattice-matched 4H-SiC$(0001)$ using molecular beam epitaxy. **High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM)**, **energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)**, and **core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)** were collectively used to confirm the epilayer as phase-pure wüstite FeO with atomically sharp FeO/SiC interfaces. The films exhibited a slight misfit strain-induced rhombohedral distortion, demonstrating the power of epitaxial stabilization for integrating thermodynamically unstable yet functionally interesting materials with technologically important semiconductor platforms.

- **Authors**: Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate how substrate morphology can be used to control and reverse the strain state in $V_{2}O_{3}$ thin films, thereby tuning its metal-insulator phase transitions.
- **Finding**: The research demonstrated that minute changes in sapphire substrate morphology (flat vs. stepped) can relax the compressive strain component induced by lattice mismatch in $V_{2}O_{3}$ films, allowing the thermally-induced tensile strain to dominate. This control over strain led to either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases across all temperatures, resulting in orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. **High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM)** was employed to image atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in the $V_{2}O_{3}$ film, elucidating the strain relaxation mechanism.

- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: To investigate the effects of Si doping into $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ to tailor the optical properties and phase change characteristics of optical phase change materials (OPCMs).
- **Finding**: The research explored Si doping into $Sb_{2}Se_{3}$ via magnetron co-sputtering, demonstrating that 20% Si doping increases the transparency window (specifically to 800 nm in the amorphous phase) and reduces power consumption by lowering the melting temperature. However, this came at the cost of reduced refractive index contrast and slower phase transition kinetics. **Scanning and transmission electron microscopy** were employed, alongside ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy, to investigate the effects of Si doping on the optical properties and crystal structure, complementing first principles calculations.

**34. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) can improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) imaging by maintaining continuous non-zero contrast transfer in the presence of higher-order aberrations.
- **Finding**: The study introduced aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC) images, to enable continuously non-zero contrast transfer within the information limit in 4D-STEM, even with higher-order aberrations. It showed that at Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF contrast transfer function. This method, demonstrated on both simulated and experimental data from **4D-STEM**, provides superior dose-efficient performance compared to tcBF or DPC methods alone.

An adaptive sampling strategy was introduced to prioritize images from domain wall regions, reducing the number of training images required while improving accuracy and interpretability. This approach was successfully demonstrated for domain mapping in ferroelectric boracite, $Cu_{3}B_{7}O_{13}Cl$, providing a powerful tool for understanding atomic-scale structural variations that govern macroscopic functionalities.

- **Objective**: To examine the distribution and evolution of lithium in both anode and cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate cycling, providing insights into lithium loss, trapping, and plating mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study investigated lithium distribution and its evolution in NMC/Graphite coin cells under high C-rate cycling using Li nuclear reaction analysis (Li-NRA). Li-NRA revealed a surface lithium peak on the anode, likely associated with SEI formation and lithium plating, while the cathode exhibited a decrease in lithium content by ~19.7%. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** equipped with **energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)**, along with X-ray diffraction, supported these findings by showing structural deformation in the cathode and an enhanced peak in the dead graphite anode consistent with metallic lithium or Cu, highlighting the impact of lithium plating on cell performance and capacity fade.

- **Authors**: Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and the corresponding microstructure on the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg-Si alloys at both microscopic and macroscopic length scales.
- **Finding**: The research characterized the crystal structure, composition, and microstructure of Al-Mg-Si alloys using X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and **scanning electron microscopy**. A microscale four-point probe setup integrated within a **scanning electron microscope** was used to directly measure the electrical resistivity of individual microstructural components, including the Al solid solution matrix and Si and $Mg_{2}Si$ precipitates. The study found that the Al solid solution matrix was up to 15% more resistive than pure Al depending on heat treatment, and regions with precipitates were equally resistive, establishing a direct relationship between microstructure and electrical properties.

- **Authors**: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To directly image and characterize the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric $SrTiO_{3}$ in real space, which has remained undefined despite decades of study.
- **Finding**: The study directly imaged the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric $SrTiO_{3}$ using **cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy** down to 20 K. High-resolution imaging revealed a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains with finite polarization. These short-range polar domains initially grew and self-organized into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers, but this process reversed below 40 K in the quantum paraelectric regime, leading to fragmentation of the periodically ordered polar nanodomains into small clusters.

- **Authors**: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman
- **Date**: 2025-09-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the viability of image reconstruction in position-blind ptychography, where scan positions are unknown and must be recovered jointly with the image, particularly for applications like single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging.
- **Finding**: This work explored the novel inverse problem of position-blind ptychography, demonstrating the viability of image reconstruction without prior knowledge of scan positions, which are recovered alongside the image. Using variational inference with score-based diffusion models as data-driven image priors in a simulated 2-D scenario, the study found that reliable and successful image reconstructions could be achieved even under measurement noise, provided there was an appropriate illumination structure and a strong prior. While focused on X-ray imaging, the principles of ptychography are directly applicable and highly relevant to advanced electron microscopy techniques.

Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling in $RuO_{2}/Fe$ bilayer heterostructures, challenging the assumption that such behavior is evidence of altermagnetic ordering in $RuO_{2}$.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that exchange bias (EB) behavior in $RuO_{2}/Fe$ bilayer heterostructures is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing $Fe_{3}O_{4}$, rather than being direct evidence of altermagnetism in $RuO_{2}$. This interlayer undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperatures. **Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy** was employed, alongside polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron reflectometry, and SQUID measurements, to confirm the presence and role of this interfacial chemical disorder, demonstrating that EB alone cannot be considered definitive evidence for altermagnetic ordering in rutile $RuO_{2}$ thin films.

- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten in air and the sublimation of tungsten oxide to assess their impact on the lifecycle and safety of fusion power plants.
- **Finding**: The research investigated the oxidation of pure W at temperatures between 400 and $1050^{\circ}C$, observing the formation of voids and cracks above $600^{\circ}C$, which could lead to dust formation or oxide spalling problematic for fusion power plant maintenance and waste handling. **Electron microscopy** and Raman spectroscopy were used for characterization, revealing a three-layer oxide scale: an inner 30-50 nm thick $WO_{2}$ layer, a middle 10-20 $\mu m$ $WO_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer $WO_{2.9}/WO_{3}$ layer. This observed microstructure was discussed in relation to the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.

**45. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that can overcome the limitations imposed by speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging, and potentially exploit speckle to improve resolution.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that speckle noise fundamentally limits light-based synthetic aperture (SA) imaging of diffuse scenes when sequential measurements are used. To overcome this, they developed a snapshot SA imaging method with an aperture-phase-synchronization strategy. Remarkably, simulations showed that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, thereby improving resolution. While this work focuses on light-based imaging, the principles of synthetic aperture and phase retrieval are highly relevant to advanced electron microscopy techniques like ptychography.

- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties of $UTe_{2}$ at ambient conditions, which hinders consensus on its superconducting order parameter.
- **Finding**: The study investigated the origin of superconducting property variations in $UTe_{2}$ using single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**. Results showed highly ordered crystalline lattices consistent with the $Immm$ structure and no uranium vacancies. However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the $Te_{2}$ layers, which host Te chains along the b-axis. These defects are argued to cause slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters in SC-XRD and disrupt the unconventional superconducting state, highlighting the critical role of structural disorder in $UTe_{2}$'s properties.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate and optimize imaging strategies for both stained and unstained 3D DNA origami nanostructures using transmission electron microscopy, given their low atomic number and imaging challenges.
- **Finding**: The study systematically evaluated imaging strategies for 3D DNA origami, demonstrating that **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** consistently delivered the highest contrast for both stained and unstained samples, with optimal performance using a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at a camera length of 600 mm. Contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining (uranyl formate, palladium), which also preserved the structures' dimensions and integrity.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To directly measure the ultrafast dynamics and phase-space correlations of optical singularity ensembles, particularly focusing on their superluminal velocities.
- **Finding**: The research directly measured the ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles, revealing that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities before annihilation, with measured velocities exceeding the speed of light. These superluminal velocities were paradoxically amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes. The phenomena were demonstrated using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in **ultrafast electron microscopy**, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, enabling unprecedented insights into topological defect dynamics and ultrafast information flow.
