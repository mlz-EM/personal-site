-   **Authors**: Nicolas Karpstein, Lukas Müller, Andreas Bezold, Steffen Neumeier, Erdmann Spiecker
-   **Date**: 2025-06-18

-   **Authors**: M. D. Dong, X. B. Cheng, M. Zhang, J. Wu
-   **Date**: 2025-06-18
-   **Objective**: To discover and investigate the coexistence and coupling of ferroelectric order and superconductivity at the interface of $LaAlO_{3}/KTaO_{3}(111)$ (LAO/KTO).
-   **Finding**: Ferroelectric order was found to reside at the LAO/KTO interface, coexisting with superconductivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed K ions displaced relative to Ta ions, aided by oxygen vacancies at the interface, confirming the ferroelectricity. Manipulating this ferroelectricity can change interfacial conductivity by over 1000 times, simultaneously causing superconductivity to diminish and reappear due to the coupling between these phenomena.

-   **Authors**: Marco Moreira, Yves Fleming, Patrick Grysan, Christele Vergne, Adrian Marie Philippe, Petru Lunca-Popa
-   **Date**: 2025-06-16
-   **Objective**: To investigate how various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) influence the structure and properties of Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.
-   **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that films grown on c-plane sapphire are epitaxial near the substrate interface but relax into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon are polycrystalline throughout. Despite limited dopant incorporation, subtle structural and optical shifts were observed, suggesting the influence of precursor chemistry and growth conditions on film stoichiometry and properties, with residual strain investigated by X-ray diffraction sin $\psi$ squared measurements.

-   **Authors**: Sebastian Lellig, Subisha Balakumar, Peter Schweizer, Eva P. Mayer, Simon Evertz, Marcus Hans, Damian M. Holzapfel, Yin Du, Qing Zhou, Martin Dienwiebel, Johann Michler, Jochen M. Schneider
-   **Date**: 2025-06-13
-   **Objective**: To design artificial sulfur-free zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by controlling their chain length through thermal annealing.
-   **Finding**: As the annealing temperature increases, the chain lengths of the zinc phosphate coatings, sputtered from a $Zn_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}$ target, are reduced, transitioning from meta- to orthophosphate. Transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX) line scans showed that the composition change observed on the surface by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) occurs throughout the entire thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length causes a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and wear resistance, enabling the design of coatings with desired mechanical properties.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the all-optical magnetization switching of a GdFe ferrimagnetic alloy using double-pulse laser excitation, exploring the effects of varying fluences and time delays between pulses.
-   **Finding**: The study found that a second laser pulse can re-switch the magnetization back if it arrives within about 40 ps after the first pulse, and for shorter delays (below 2 ps), the effects of the two pulses add up, enabling switching below the single-pulse threshold. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and Kerr microscopy were used for magnetic domain imaging, providing direct visualization of the magnetization states and their dynamics, successfully confirmed by atomistic spin dynamics simulations.
