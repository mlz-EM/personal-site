- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Investigate the interplay between temperature and film thickness on ferroelastic domain wall (DW) morphology and dynamics in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: A distinct interplay was mapped: DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) are mobile near $T_C$ and freeze upon cooling, while DWs in the crossover regime (200-300 nm) are nearly static. In situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), coupled with machine learning analysis, was used to track DW curvature and density across the thermal super-elastic to freezing regimes.

**14. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies (topological-Hall-like resistivity) observed in a $\text{Zn-doped Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet.
- **Finding**: The observed Hall-resistivity anomalies showed little correlation with magnetic transitions, suggesting a trivial origin distinct from the topological Hall effect. Crucially, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures, leading to the conclusion that the anomalies result from the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels due to sample inhomogeneity.

- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector differential phase contrast (DPC) STEM.
