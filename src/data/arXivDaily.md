**1. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) phase retrieval methods, addressing the limitations of the conventional contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that SSNR, unlike CTF, effectively accounts for finite electron fluence and Poisson-limited detection, providing a more realistic evaluation of STEM phase retrieval performance, particularly in low-dose regimes. Numerical reconstructions showed that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs with analytic expressions, while iterative ptychography displays a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography's SSNR at low fluence and saturating at high fluence consistent with quantum Fisher information bounds. This work highlights SSNR as a superior metric for evaluating STEM phase retrieval methods.

- **Authors**: Elizaveta Gangrskaia, Thomas Schachinger, Christoph Eisenmenger-Sittner, Lorenz Grünewald, Sebastian Mai, Andrius Baltuška, Audrius Pugžlys, Alessandra Bellissimo
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To develop an approach that combines structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and high-contrast optical magnetic field excitation in Eu$^{3+}$ ions.
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully generated spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses, optimized for selective excitation of magnetic and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. They demonstrated that excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam in the presence of the metallic antenna provided a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition compared to other beams, opening new opportunities for spectroscopy of forbidden transitions. While "nanoscale sample engineering" is mentioned, the abstract does not explicitly detail the contribution of electron microscopy techniques to the findings.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To experimentally observe and characterize the atomic-scale organization of dipoles within polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, specifically focusing on the formation of charged 180-degree domain walls.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that within the irreducibly narrow polar layers of ZrO$_2$, dipole organization is strikingly non-uniform, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls that alternate between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations. These walls adopt distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-nm$^2$ footprint, representing some of the smallest domains reported. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film in plan-view orientation was crucial for this first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering via strongly charged domain walls nested within self-organized polar-nonpolar layering, revealing a novel hierarchical self-organization of polar textures at the atomic scale.

**4. [Atomic-Scale Heterogeneity of Hydrogen in Metal Hydrides Revealed by Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18906v1)**
- **Authors**: Pengcheng Li, Chenglin Pua, Zehao Dong, Zhengxiong Su, Tao Liu, Chao Cai, Huahai Shen, Lin Gu, Zhen Chen
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To precisely determine the atomic-scale distribution of hydrogen in metal hydrides, overcoming the challenges posed by hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by providing exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP resolved heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantified hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work establishes MEP as a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.

**5. [Relaxing Direct Ptychography Sampling Requirements via Parallax Imaging Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18610v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements of direct ptychography by leveraging insights from parallax imaging.
- **Finding**: The authors formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, using this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. This allows for the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave with relaxed probe step size requirements, traditionally a limiting factor for resolution. The analytical results were demonstrated numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions, showing a significant advancement in electron ptychography techniques.

**6. [Programmable phase selection between altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe on InP via molecular beam epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18592v1)**
- **Authors**: An-Hsi Chen, Parul R. Raghuvanshi, Jacob Cook, Michael Chilcote, Jason Lapano, Alessandro R. Mazza, Qiangsheng Lu, Sangsoo Kim, Yueh-Chun Wu, T. Zac Ward, Benjamin Lawrie, Guang Bian, James Burns, Jonathan D. Poplawsky, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Lucas Lindsay, Hu Miao, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Valentino R. Cooper, Matthew Brahlek
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: The study successfully demonstrated that the phase selection of MnTe polymorphs (hexagonal NiAs-structure or cubic ZnS-structure) can be controlled by the InP substrate termination ((111)A for NiAs, (111)B for ZnS). Electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction collectively indicated that phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface. This work provides high-quality MnTe films for understanding novel properties and applications in spintronics and microelectronics.

**7. [Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364v1)**
- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions in FeRh thin films under cumulative laser irradiation.
- **Finding**: The study observed that repeated laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films, switching it from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices, pinned by underlying dislocation networks, as preferential nucleation motifs. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high structural and magnetic resolution was crucial to observe the formation and rearrangement of these dislocation networks upon repeated phase transition crossings using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses, establishing a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase.

**8. [Tuning chiral anomaly signature in a Dirac semimetal via fast-ion implantation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17972v1)**
- **Authors**: Manasi Mandal, Eunbi Rha, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, Denisse Córdova Carrizales, Alexander Lygo, Kevin B. Woller, Mouyang Cheng, Ryotaro Okabe, Guomin Zhu, Kiran Mak, Chu-Liang Fu, Chuhang Liu, Lijun Wu, Yimei Zhu, Susanne Stemmer, Mingda Li
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To enhance the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR), a signature of chiral anomaly, in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films using accelerator-based fast ion implantation.
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully enhanced the maximum NLMR in Nb-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films by over 100% compared to pristine films, reaching maximums at higher magnetic fields (7 T for surface-doped, >9 T for bulk-doped) while maintaining crystallinity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used, alongside electrical transport measurements, to characterize the NLMR and confirm the crystallinity of the films after ion implantation. This work demonstrates the potential of high-energy ion implantation as a practical route to realize chiralitronic functionalities in topological semimetals.

**9. [Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940v2)**
- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals using levitated optomechanics with functionalized silica nanoparticles.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) with oligonucleotides, when optically trapped in vacuum, exhibited detectable differences in their oscillation frequency, width, and amplitude compared to non-functionalized SiNPs. These differences could be explained by a theoretical model and were successfully distinguished using linear discriminant analysis and random forest modeling. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed but *did not reveal any visual differences* between the particle types, indicating that the optomechanical method was sensitive to subtle surface functionalization not visible by TEM.

**10. [Computation and Sensitivity Analysis of the Deformation-Gradient Tensor Reconstruction in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17929v1)**
- **Authors**: Brinthan Kanesalingam, Darshan Chalise, Carsten Detlefs, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To develop an inverse modeling framework for explicitly relating angular shifts in Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to strain and lattice rotation tensors, and to perform sensitivity analysis for the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor.
- **Finding**: The authors developed a computational framework that enables the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) using oblique diffraction geometry in DFXM. This framework allows for both forward calculation of anticipated angular shifts and reconstruction of the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for individual pixels. Furthermore, they established methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific DFXM angles and compute associated errors. While DFXM is an X-ray technique, the paper implicitly highlights its advantages over electron microscopy (TEM and EBSD) for bulk material imaging.

**11. [Improving Multislice Electron Ptychography with a Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17800v2)**
- **Authors**: Christian K. Belardi, Chia-Hao Lee, Yingheng Wang, Justin Lovelace, Kilian Q. Weinberger, David A. Muller, Carla P. Gomes
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To enhance the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes in multislice electron ptychography (MEP) by integrating a generative prior using a diffusion model.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on crystal structures, which can be easily integrated as a generative prior into existing iterative MEP solvers via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). This hybrid approach significantly improved the quality of reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods. This work directly advances computational electron microscopy, specifically multislice electron ptychography, by addressing the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and producing higher-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns.

**12. [Chiral lone-pair helices with handedness coupling to electric-strain fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17473v1)**
- **Authors**: C. R. Zeiger, R. S. Dragland, R. Sjökvist, R. Beanland, D. Meier, T. Grande, M. S. Senn, O. G. Grendal
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality in tetragonal tungsten bronzes (K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$) and investigate the origin of their chirality and its coupling to electric-strain fields.
- **Finding**: The study confirmed ferrochirality in the two tungsten bronzes, revealing an achiral-to-chiral phase transition from P4/mbm to P4$_2$12(00$\gamma$)q00. The chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms perpendicular to the c-direction, identified as the primary order parameter. High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures. A spatially varying piezoelectric response was observed as a secondary effect, and invariant analysis proposed an external electric-strain-field coupling for switching chirality, establishing these materials as a versatile playground for ferrochirality.

**13. [Mechanistic Insights into Nonthermal Ablation of Copper Nanoparticles under Femtosecond Laser Irradiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17100v1)**
- **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanisms of undesired ablation during femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation of copper (Cu) nanoparticles, particularly focusing on fragmentation and coalescence behavior.
- **Finding**: The study revealed a bimodal transformation of Cu nanoparticles under fs laser scanning, showing emergence of sub-60 nm debris and formation of large aggregates up to 750 nm. By evaluating candidate mechanisms, they identified hot electron blast as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and blast pressures above 4 GPa, contrasting with Coulomb explosion which was deemed unlikely. Particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were crucial for characterizing the fragmentation and coalescence behavior, providing experimental evidence for the proposed nonthermal ablation mechanism.

**14. [Microstructure of Silicon Anodes in Solid-State Batteries -- From Crystalline to Amorphous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16561v1)**
- **Authors**: Shamail Ahmed, Federico Rossi, Hanyu Huo, Johannes Haust, Franziska Hueppe, Juergen Belz, Andreas Beyer, Juergen Janek, Kerstin Volz
- **Date**: 2025-07-22
- **Objective**: To investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling, specifically focusing on the transition from crystalline to amorphous states.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that after the first lithiation, the silicon electrode exhibited a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li$_{15}$Si$_4$, various amorphous Li$_x$Si phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features. By the 10th delithiation, a more uniform, predominantly amorphous microstructure emerged, mainly with thread-like regions at grain boundaries. Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was essential for investigating this microstructural evolution, ensuring structural integrity by preventing ambient exposure and providing high-resolution imaging throughout the cycling process.

**15. [Size-Dependent Lattice Pseudosymmetry for Frustrated Decahedral Nanoparticles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14781v1)**
- **Authors**: Oliver Lin, Zhiheng Lyu, Hsu-Chih Ni, Xiaokang Wang, Yetong Jia, Chu-Yun Hwang, Lehan Yao, Jian-Min Zuo, Qian Chen
- **Date**: 2025-07-20
- **Objective**: To understand the fundamental structural properties of multi-twinned decahedral nanoparticles, specifically how intrinsic lattice strain and pseudosymmetric features evolve with varying sizes and geometries.
- **Finding**: The study applied four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) strain mapping to 23 decahedral nanoparticles (edge lengths between 20 and 55 nm), revealing heterogeneity in lattice distortions that homogenizes and restores symmetry with increasing size. This revealed distinctive spatial patterns of local lattice phase transformation between face-centered cubic and body-centered tetragonal symmetries, with a cross-over size around 35 nm. The 4D-STEM mapping provided nanometer spatial resolution maps of the full 2D strain tensor, offering new insights into the internal structure and size-dependent shape transitions of these historic systems.

**16. [Plasmonic Color Filters Enable Label-Free Plasmon-Enhanced Array Tomography with sub-diffraction limited resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12786v1)**
- **Authors**: Kristian Caracciolo, Eugeniu Balaur, Erinna F. Lee, W. Douglas Fairlie, Julian Ratcliffe, Eric Hanssen, David Hoxley, Jacqueline Orian, Chad Johnson, Lu Yu, Kang Han, Wei Xiang, Brian Abbey
- **Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Objective**: To develop and demonstrate a new label-free imaging technique, plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography, for 3D imaging of subcellular organization and morphology with sub-diffraction limited resolution.
- **Finding**: The study successfully demonstrated ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography, which translates subtle changes in refractive index directly into color using plasmonic metamaterials. This approach enables label-free visualization of tissue microstructure with axial super-resolution (30-200 nm). Crucially, the researchers correlated this optical method with electron array tomography of the *same sample* embedded in resin, validating the technique's ability to provide multimodal three-dimensional colorimetric histology at the (sub-)organelle level.

**17. [Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11468v2)**
- **Authors**: Jiesen Guo, Fan Yang, Yuzhou He, Xinyang Liu, Zheng Deng, Qinghua Zhang, Xiancheng Wang, Xianlei Sheng, Wei Li, Changqing Jin, Kan Zhao
- **Date**: 2025-07-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in the hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal.
- **Finding**: The study found that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ exhibits long-range A-type antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K, with strong magnetic anisotropy. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability. Despite DFT calculations predicting it as a semiconductor, the single crystal exhibited metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely due to these interstitial P atoms. This work establishes GdZn$_3$P$_3$ as a concrete example for investigating coupling between charge carriers and triangular lattice magnetism on the background of short-range bond order.

**18. [Unveiling Zn incorporation in CuInS$_2$ quantum dots: X-ray and optical analysis of doping effects, structural modifications and surface passivation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11338v1)**
- **Authors**: Andrés Burgos-Caminal, Brener R. C. Vale, André F. V. Fonseca, Juan F. Hidalgo, Elisa P. P. Collet, Lázaro García, Víctor Vega-Mayoral, Saül Garcia-Orrit, Iciar Arnay, Juan Cabanillas-González, Laura Simonelli, Ana Flávia Nogueira, Marco Antônio Schiavon, Thomas J. Penfold, Lazaro A. Padilha, Wojciech Gawelda
- **Date**: 2025-07-15
- **Objective**: To characterize and quantify Zn incorporation in CuInS$_2$ quantum dots (QDs) using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved optical spectroscopies, to understand its role in structural modifications and surface passivation.
- **Finding**: The study successfully utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent or an interstitial defect. Optical and dynamical properties were also explored. The abstract explicitly states that "characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging," and that XAS was used instead, indicating electron microscopy was not the primary technique for the key findings related to Zn incorporation.

**19. [Correlating synthesis, structure and thermal stability of CuBi nanowires for spintronic applications by electron microscopy and in situ scattering methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09553v1)**
- **Authors**: Alejandra Guedeja-Marrón, Henrik Lyder Andersen, Gabriel Sánchez-Santolino, Lunjie Zeng, Alok Ranjan, Inés García-Manuz, François Fauth, Catherine Dejoie, Eva Olsson, Paolo Perna, Maria Varela, Lucas Pérez, Matilde Saura-Múzquiz
- **Date**: 2025-07-13
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural properties and thermal stability of Bi-doped copper (Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$) nanowires, correlating synthesis conditions with their microstructure for spintronic applications.
- **Finding**: The study fabricated Cu$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ nanowires with varying Bi content and crystalline domain sizes, finding that larger crystalline domains allowed homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, while smaller domains showed Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. Advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques were crucial for structural analysis, revealing the influence of synthesis on crystal structure, microstructure, Bi localization, crystallite dimensions, and lattice distortions. Thermal stability analysis showed lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice upon heating. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing spin Hall effect performance by correlating synthesis with microstructural features and thermal behavior.

- **Authors**: Julia Kucharek, Mateusz Raczyński, Rafał Bożek, Anna Kaleta, Bogusława Kurowska, Marta Bilska, Sławomir Kret, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Piotr Kossacki, Mateusz Goryca, Wojciech Pacuski
- **Date**: 2025-07-12
- **Objective**: To develop a three-step molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) process for growing high-quality, optically uniform WSe$_2$ monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).
- **Finding**: The researchers successfully optimized an MBE process to maximize photoluminescence efficiency and promote hexagonal WSe$_2$ domain formation on hBN. The monolayer character of the film was identified using optical methods and verified with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section. Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent studies revealed exciton complex behavior analogous to exfoliated counterparts, demonstrating superior convenience and reproducibility compared to mechanically exfoliated WSe$_2$. This work represents significant progress in the optical quality of epitaxially grown transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers for large-scale functional devices.

**21. [Structural optimization of lattice-matched Sc$_{0.14}$Al$_{0.86}$N/GaN superlattices for photonic applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08951v1)**
- **Authors**: Rajendra Kumar, Govardan Gopakumar, Zain Ul Abdin, Michael J. Manfra, Oana Malis
- **Date**: 2025-07-11
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the molecular-beam epitaxy of short-period Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN superlattices to achieve low defect complex multilayers for quantum photonic devices.
- **Finding**: The study confirmed lattice-matching at $x = 0.14$ Sc composition for Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN superlattices, irrespective of GaN interlayer thickness, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction. Superlattices deviating from this condition exhibited strain-induced defects. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigation of the Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor influencing nitride composition variation and band structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) also revealed delays in Sc incorporation relative to Al. Optimal growth conditions were determined, advancing the integration of Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N with GaN for photonic applications.

**22. [Strain-Stabilized Interfacial Polarization Tunes Work Function Over 1 eV in RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$ Heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07579v1)**
- **Authors**: Seung Gyo Jeong, Bonnie Y. X. Lin, Mengru Jin, In Hyeok Choi, Seungjun Lee, Zhifei Yang, Sreejith Nair, Rashmi Choudhary, Juhi Parikh, Anand Santhosh, Matthew Neurock, Kelsey A. Stoerzinger, Jong Seok Lee, Tony Low, Qing Tu, James M. LeBeau, Bharat Jalan
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that interfacial polarization can robustly modulate the surface work function in metallic rutile RuO$_2$ layers within epitaxial RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$ heterostructures.
- **Finding**: The study successfully demonstrated over 1 eV modulation of the RuO$_2$ work function, controlled by small thickness variation (2-4 nm), with a critical thickness of 4 nm. This was achieved by leveraging strain-stabilized interfacial polarization in metallic RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$ heterostructures. Multislice electron ptychography was crucial for directly visualizing polar displacements of transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite the conductive nature of RuO$_2$. This work establishes interfacial polarization as a powerful route to control electronic properties in metals, with implications for designing tunable electronic, catalytic, and quantum devices.

**23. [Mass-transport-limited reaction rates and molecular diffusion in the van der Waals gap beneath graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07479v1)**
- **Authors**: Hossein Mirdamadi, Jiří David, Rui Wang, Tianle Jiang, Yanming Wang, Karel Vařeka, Michal Dymáček, Petr Bábor, Tomáš Šikola, Miroslav Kolíbal
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To study the dynamics of graphene etching by various molecules (O$_2$, H$_2$, and CO) within the van der Waals (vdW) gap beneath multilayer graphene on platinum, and identify kinetic limitations of such confined reactions.
- **Finding**: The study found that under the explored experimental conditions, the graphene etching reaction rates within the vdW gap were limited by mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persisted even for CO, which exhibited anomalously enhanced transport due to a significant lifting of the vdW gap. In situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to study the etching dynamics, providing direct visual evidence of the process within the vdW gap. The findings suggest that once mass-transport limitations are overcome, the vdW gap acts as an effective nanoreactor, facilitating otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways.

**24. [3D Atomic-Scale Metrology of Strain Relaxation and Roughness in Gate-All-Around (GAA) Transistors via Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07265v1)**
- **Authors**: Shake Karapetyan, Steven E. Zeltmann, Glen Wilk, Ta-Kun Chen, Vincent D. -H. Hou, David A. Muller
- **Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Objective**: To enable 3D atomic-scale metrology of buried features, specifically strain relaxation and interface roughness, in next-generation gate-all-around (GAA) transistors.
- **Finding**: The study successfully applied multislice electron ptychography (MEP) to prototype GAA transistors, uncovering and quantifying distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. MEP, with its sub-Ångström lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution, revealed that silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of atoms in a bulk-like structure. It also quantified atomic-scale interface roughness, showing different profiles for top and bottom interfaces reflecting processing conditions. This work demonstrates MEP's capability to measure 3D interface roughness, strain relaxation, and atomic-scale defects from a single dataset, providing critical performance-limiting parameters for modeling and fabrication optimization.

**25. [Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06756v1)**
- **Authors**: Tamazouzt Chennit, Songge Li, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Christoph Hofer, Nadine J. Schrenker, Liberato Manna, Sara Bals, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
- **Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Objective**: To investigate the convergence properties of iterative electron ptychography methods, particularly focusing on the impact of user-defined update strengths for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that carefully chosen, relatively small update strengths for both object and probe are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential in iterative electron ptychography, especially under low electron doses ($<$ 10$^3$ e$^-$/Å$^2$). Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic FAPbBr$_3$ sample, they showed that convergence is practically achievable only with these smaller update strengths, and that reducing them below a certain threshold increases the initial reconstruction error, trapping algorithms in local minima. These findings highlight the critical need for optimizing reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography to ensure effective convergence and correctness of results in low-dose atomic-resolution imaging.

**26. [Bilayer graphene as a template for manufacturing novel 2D materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06447v1)**
- **Authors**: Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Yung-Chang Lin, Kazu Suenaga
- **Date**: 2025-07-08
- **Objective**: Summarize recent progress in using free-standing bilayer graphene (BLG) as a template for manufacturing and tuning 2D materials (2DMs) through intercalation.
- **Finding**: Bilayer graphene (BLG) enables the stabilization of marginally stable layered materials and the synthesis of entirely new 2D systems within its layers, offering easier intercalation and much larger increase in the inter-layer separation compared to bulk graphite. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is highlighted as a crucial technique for studying the atomic structure of the intercalated 2DMs.
