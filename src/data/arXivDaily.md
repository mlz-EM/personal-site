- **Date**: 2025-06-19
- **Objective**: Synthesize tin disulfide (SnS$_2$) nanotubes with a preferred armchair configuration using a sacrificial template and investigate the mechanism behind this chirality-selective growth.

**19. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
