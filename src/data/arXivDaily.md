**1. [Electrical resistivity of microstructural components in Al-Mg-Si alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25089v1)**
- **Authors**: Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: Investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and microstructure on the electrical resistivity of overaged Al-Mg-Si alloys.
- **Finding**: The Al solid solution matrix was found to be up to 15% more resistive than pure Al, with resistivity depending on heat treatment rather than composition. Regions containing Si or Mg$_2$Si precipitates showed similar resistivity. A microscale four-point probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was directly used to measure the electrical resistivity of individual microstructural components, while X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) characterized the crystal structure, composition, and microstructure.

- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: Directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ to define its precise real-space structure.
- **Finding**: High-resolution cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) down to 20 K revealed a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains with finite polarization. These short-range polar domains initially grow and self-organize into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers, but then fragment into small clusters when entering the quantum paraelectric regime below 40 K.

**5. [Understanding the oxidation of pure Tungsten in air and its impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22031v1)**
- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: Investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten (W) and the sublimation of W oxide to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
- **Finding**: Oxidation of W at temperatures between 400 and 1050°C revealed the formation of voids and cracks above 600°C, leading to dust or oxide spalling. Electron microscopy characterization, alongside Raman spectroscopy, revealed that the oxide scale consists of three main layers: an inner 30-50 nm thick WO$_2$ oxide, a middle 10-20 µm WO$_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer WO$_{2.9}$/WO$_3$ layer whose thickness varies with the total oxide scale. This microstructural understanding is critical for assessing tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.

**6. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: Develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome speckle noise limitations in macroscale light-based SA imaging.
- **Finding**: The study proved that sequential measurements suffering from per-measurement-independent speckle fundamentally prevent SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes. A novel snapshot SA imaging method was developed that can overcome this limitation. Simulations further demonstrated that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, thereby improving resolution.

- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: Systematically investigate the synthesis of 2D indium selenide (InSe) via MOCVD on c-plane sapphire substrates at low temperatures.
- **Finding**: By varying the Se/In precursor ratio and growth temperature, a phase diagram was established, confirming conditions under which 2D InSe forms. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), supported by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), confirmed the formation of 2D InSe and revealed an epitaxial alignment with the sapphire substrate mediated by a specific interface reconstruction. The epitaxial alignment was further verified by in-plane X-ray diffraction.

- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: Investigate the origin of the observed sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_2$ at ambient conditions.
- **Finding**: Single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices consistent with the expected $Immm$ structure, with no signs of uranium vacancies. However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the Te$_2$ layers, which are argued to cause slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters and disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_2$, emphasizing the importance of structural perfection for its superconducting properties.

- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: Systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained 3D DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids to optimize structural visualization.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) consistently delivered the highest contrast for DNA origami, with optimal performance achieved using a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at a camera length of 600 mm. Contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate, and complexation with palladium also improved visibility while largely retaining structural integrity. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami, even for unstained samples, and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: Directly measure the ultrafast dynamics and phase-space correlations of optical singularity ensembles.
- **Finding**: The study observed phase singularities exhibiting acceleration to unbounded, superluminal velocities before annihilation, paradoxically amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes. These phenomena were demonstrated using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, enabling the probing of topological defect dynamics at previously unattainable timescales.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: Develop a method for directly tracking the three-dimensional (3D) atomic structural evolution of individual bimetallic nanocatalysts during electrocatalytic reactions.
- **Finding**: The researchers developed four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, which enabled direct tracking of 3D atomic rearrangements in single Pd-Pt bimetallic nanocatalysts throughout electrocatalytic cycles. They observed two stages of evolution—surface reconstruction and atom leaching—corroborated by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. This method identified chemical short-range order at the atomic level and revealed anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations, highlighting the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into nanocatalyst design.

- **Authors**: Ernst Artes, Primiana Cavallo, Tobias Häger, Carl-Christian Meyer, Christoph Mokry, Dennis Renisch, Jörg Runke, Evgenia Schaffner, Alice Seibert, Christina Trautmann, Christoph E. Düllmann
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Objective**: Elucidate a possible influence of water and carbon dioxide present in the plating solution on the quality of terbium and thulium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: The study found that water concentrations exceeding 1 vol.-% negatively affect the quality of the thin films, and the presence of CO$_2$ leads to an increased carbonate content, which also detrimentally influences film quality. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the morphology of the thin films, providing visual evidence of how these contaminants impact the film structure. Chemical analysis using infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further revealed the formation of hydroxides, oxides, and carbonates.

- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: Observe and understand the size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes.
- **Finding**: In-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperatures down to 20 K revealed a melting point depression of CDWs for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm, and an absence of CDWs in very small flakes. This observation, consistent with classical nucleation theory, was analyzed using a Ginzburg-Landau model, which estimated a zero-temperature correlation length of 10-50 nm, matching reported CDW domain sizes. The finite flake size limits long-range order, thereby lowering the transition temperature.

**15. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: Develop a method to correct scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements to accurately estimate true surface pore size and porosity in nanoporous membranes, accounting for imaging artifacts.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings during SEM imaging lead to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. A digital correction method, simulating pore dilation, was developed to estimate the pore structure of uncoated membranes. This method yielded 2-3 fold greater porosities and 1.5-2 fold greater mean pore diameters for UF and RO membranes compared to coated images, with dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreeing with low-flux dextran-retention data. This highlights SEM's critical role in characterizing nanoscale surface pores, but also the necessity of artifact correction.

- **Authors**: Kousuke Ooe, Yufan Shen, Kazuki Shitara, Shunsuke Kobayashi, Yuichi Shimakawa, Daisuke Kan, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: Directly observe polarization switching pathways by visualizing oxygen site dynamics in fluorite ferroelectrics (ZrO$_2$ and Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$) at the atomic scale.
- **Finding**: Using optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the study directly observed that 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, it was revealed how different cation species in fluorite oxides impact the accessible polarization switching pathways. These atomic-level insights into oxygen displacement-driven ferroelectricity are crucial for engineering next-generation non-volatile memory devices.

- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: Investigate the underlying mechanism of substantial coercivity in Ce(Co$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)$_{5.4}$ permanent magnets by identifying nanoscale pinning centers.
- **Finding**: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) directly identified a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition, consisting of Cu-poor cylindrical cells and Cu-rich cell boundaries. Micromagnetic simulations, informed by these microstructural observations, demonstrated that intrinsic Cu concentration gradients (up to 12 at.% Cu/nm) lead to spatial variations in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity.

- **Authors**: Ruiqi Zhang, Jamie Geng, Shaun Tan, Shreyas Srinivasan, Taehyung Kim, Mayuran Saravanapavanantham, Kwang-Hee Lim, Mike Dillender, Heejae Chung, Thienan Nguyen, Karen Yang, Yongli Lu, Taegon Kim, Moungi G. Bawendi, Vladimir Bulovic
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: Understand the underlying degradation mechanisms in Cd-free colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) during operation.
- **Finding**: The study observed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer (ETL), QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer during QD-LED operation, accompanied by the generation and diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen radicals. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. Acrylate-based resin encapsulation stabilized the ETL/QD layers by suppressing radical formation and halting morphology changes, leading to dramatic lifetime enhancements.

**22. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v2)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: Compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron ptychography phase imaging using detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: The study applied the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance. It found that for a weak-phase object, ptychography cannot reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but is more robust to partial coherence. This comparison provides a quantitative metric for evaluating and optimizing imaging techniques like HRTEM and ptychography for beam-sensitive materials.

- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: Uncover and understand the reconstruction behavior, stabilization, and reactivity of the polar CeO$_2$(100) surface.
- **Finding**: An integrated approach, including in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), discovered a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO$_2$(100) surface. This reconstruction, characterized by alternating Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ ions and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms, was found to be thermodynamically and kinetically stable. The formation of localized Ce$^{3+}$ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, activating the O 2p states and enhancing electron-donating capacity, which facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules like H$_2$O.

- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam scanning trajectories on dose efficiency and artifact suppression in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography.
- **Finding**: This study demonstrated that ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieve atomic resolution and are robust to large jumps in probe position, while atomic-resolution EELS maps show sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Electron microscopy, specifically 4D-STEM with programmable beam control, was crucial for comparing spatial resolution, spectral fidelity, and artifact suppression across different scan modes, and showed that spiral scanning improves dose uniformity and mitigates drift distortions in cryogenic EELS.

- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) in In$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable NDR with high peak-to-valley ratios in In$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ FeS-FETs, attributing it to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. High-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) combined with electrical transport measurements revealed that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moiré patterns), and intralayer shear, collectively producing stress-induced phase transitions at the atomic scale.

- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
