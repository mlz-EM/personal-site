**33. [Anisotropy at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ ($R$=rare earth, $T$=transition metal) magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07724v1)**
- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: To determine the intrinsic magnetic properties, particularly anisotropy, at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ magnets using first-principles calculations based on experimentally derived structures.
- **Finding**: The study used first-principles calculations on model interface structures derived from recently reported high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images to determine their intrinsic magnetic properties. HREM provided atomistic-scale insight into two interface structures: a stoichiometric twin and a stacking fault. The calculations revealed that these interfaces modify magnetic properties at the sub-nanometer scale, with the local easy axis of magnetization rotating by $49^\circ$ in the R-rich region of the stacking fault, which may lead to reduced coercivity.

- **Authors**: Nina M. Ivanova, Alexey S. Kashin, Valentine P. Ananikov
- **Date**: 2025-08-10
- **Objective**: To estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications.

- **Authors**: Qing Cheng, Sergey V. Erohin, Konstantin V. Larionov, Bin Gan, Pavel B. Sorokin, Xiandong Xu
- **Date**: 2025-08-09
- **Objective**: To identify the microscopic mechanism responsible for the intrinsic brittleness of single crystal iridium.

Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial for directly observing these dislocation loops, showing their formation via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed perfect dislocations under stress. These immobile loops act as potent barriers, drastically increasing yield strength and work hardening by impeding dislocation glide and consuming mobile dislocations.

- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, specifically $La_{2}PrNi_{2}O_{7+\delta}$.
- **Finding**: The study found that Pr dopants in as-grown $La_{2}PrNi_{2}O_{7}$ preferentially occupy outer La sites, ensuring near-stoichiometry and bulk superconductivity under pressure. Using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), the researchers revealed that high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers, which ultimately suppresses superconductivity. This highlights a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity, contrasting with cuprates where similar ordering enhances superconductivity.

- **Authors**: Michael J Abere, Paul G. Kotula, Jonathan S. Paras, David P. Adams
- **Date**: 2025-08-02
- **Objective**: To directly measure the premixed phase at the interfaces of sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers, which undergo self-propagating formation reactions.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to directly observe the crystallinity of this phase, which differs from previously predicted amorphous interlayers. The disordered FCC phase retained its symmetry after annealing, with a lattice parameter shift consistent with an Al-rich composition, attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.

- **Date**: 2025-07-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural and magnetic properties of $Fe_{3}GaTe_{2}$ to understand the presence of topological spin textures and its magnetic ground state.
- **Finding**: The study showed, through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, that $Fe_{3}GaTe_{2}$ single crystals exhibit local inversion symmetry breaking despite global centrosymmetry, providing an explanation for the observed Néel skyrmions via Lorentz-TEM. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicated a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase transition to a globally ferrimagnetic ground state, not a glassy state, associated with a change in magnetic configuration between Fe1 and Fe2 moments. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) revealed magnetic bubbles at the phase boundary, suggesting skyrmions stabilized by competing magnetic phases.
