**1. [Microscopic evidence of dominant excitonic instability in Ta2NiSe5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03011v1)
- **Authors**: Seokjin Bae, Arjun Raghavan, Irena Feldman, Amit Kanigel, Vidya Madhavan
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: To present microscopic evidence supporting the excitonic origin of the insulating phase in $\text{Ta}_2\text{Ni}\text{Se}_5$, distinguishing it from the accompanying structural distortion.
- **Finding**: Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) revealed that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent, suggesting the distortion is not the primary origin of the insulating state. Furthermore, the gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles, and the decay length of in-gap states matches the estimated exciton wavefunction size, strongly supporting the classification of $\text{Ta}_2\text{Ni}\text{Se}_5$ as an excitonic insulator (EI).

**2. [Realization of polytype heterostructures via delicate structural transitions from a doped-Mott insulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02778v1)**
- **Authors**: Yanyan Geng, Manyu Wang, Shumin Meng, Shuo Mi, Chang Li, Huiji Hu, Jianfeng Guo, Rui Xu, Fei Pang, Wei Ji, Weichang Zhou, Zhihai Cheng
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: To realize vertical/lateral polytype heterostructures in a hole-doped Mott insulator via thermal-annealing-induced structural transitions and clarify the interfacial coupling between distinct quantum phases.
- **Finding**: The coexistence of 1T-H polytype heterostructures was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy, AFM, and SKPM. Atomic-scale STM/STS revealed a "transparent effect" in $1\text{H}/1\text{T}$ vertical heterostructures where the charge density wave (CDW) of the underlying $1\text{T}$-layer superposes on the top $1\text{H}$-layer. The metallic $1\text{H}$-layer was shown to impose a Coulomb screening effect on the $1\text{T}$-layer, suppressing CDW domain walls and forming more ordered electronic states.

**3. [Precise Twist Angle Determination in twisted WSe2 via Optical Moiré Phonons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02615v1)**
- **Authors**: Nicolai-Leonid Bathen, Thorsten Deilmann, Ana Senkić, Hendrik Lambers, Rami Dana, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Frances M. Ross, Julian Klein, Ursula Wurstbauer
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: To establish micro-Raman spectroscopy of optical moiré phonons as a rapid, non-invasive probe for determining the local twist angle and its spatial variations in twisted $\text{W}\text{Se}_2$ bilayers.
- **Finding**: Correlative Lateral Force Microscopy (LFM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy uncovered lateral variations in the twist angle exceeding $1^{\circ}$ across micrometer length scales. Optical moiré phonons exhibit a distinct Raman response for twist angles $3^{\circ} < \alpha < 12^{\circ}$, allowing for twist angle determination with a precision better than $\pm 0.3^{\circ}$ and sub-micrometer spatial resolution.

**4. [Evaluation of carbon incorporation in sulfide thin films grown by hybrid pulsed laser deposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02168v1)**
- **Authors**: Claire Wu, Mythili Surendran, Shin Muramoto, Alexander Grutter, Jayakanth Ravichandran
- **Date**: 2025-12-01
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanisms governing unintentional carbon (C) incorporation from organosulfur precursors (tert-butyl disulfide, TBDS) during the growth of sulfide thin films by hybrid pulsed laser deposition (hPLD).
- **Finding**: Optimal growth temperatures were identified for $\text{ZnS}$, $\text{Ti}\text{S}_2$, and $\text{Ba}\text{Ti}\text{S}_3$ that minimize C incorporation and maximize texture. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction showed that growth outside these optimal temperatures leads to increased C incorporation, correlating with degraded texture. For $\text{Ti}\text{S}_2$, high TBDS pressure resulted in the loss of preferential texture, likely due to C graphitization poisoning the interface and bulk.

**5. [Reversible nanopore sealing and in situ iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis on thin silicon nitride membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01726v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehui Xia, Pia Bhatia, Celia Morral, Brian DiPaolo, Iryna Golovina, Adriana Buvač-Drndić, Chih-Yuan Lin, David Niedzwiecki, Marija Drndić
- **Date**: 2025-12-01
- **Objective**: To report the in-situ chemical synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles inside silicon nitride nanopores and monitor the resulting reversible sealing process.
- **Finding**: Nanopores (fabricated via electroporation, TEM drilling, or HF etching) in 5 to 20 nm thick membranes sealed reversibly on timescales ranging from $\sim 1 \text{ ms}$ to $\sim 3.6 \text{ s}$ due to the in-situ synthesis of iron oxide particles. Aberration-corrected Scanning TEM (AC-STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) verified the synthesized material as mixed magnetite and maghemite iron oxide.

- **Date**: 2025-11-30
- **Objective**: To present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of monolayer graphene on insulating perovskite oxide substrates ($\text{Sr}\text{Ti}\text{O}_3$, $\text{La}\text{Al}\text{O}_3$, etc.) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
- **Finding**: Uniform, continuous monolayer graphene was successfully grown on all tested perovskite substrates under the same optimal growth conditions. Comprehensive characterization, including Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Electron Microscopy, confirmed the structure. Low-temperature STM on the graphene/$\text{Sr}\text{Ti}\text{O}_3$ heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, specifically substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

**7. [CsCl seed layer homogenizes co-evaporated perovskite growth for high-efficiency fully textured perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23004v1)**
- **Authors**: Viktor Škorjanc, Stefanie Severin, Alexander Veber, Mauricio J. Prieto, Liviu C. Tănase, Aleksandra Miaskiewicz, Sebastian Weitz, Jing-Wen Hsueh, Mohamad-Assaad Mawass, Lucas de Souza Caldas, Suresh Manyarasu, Philippe Holzhey, Erik Wutke, Stepan Demchyshyn, Matthew R. Leyden, Angelika Harter, Roberto Felix Duarte, Jona Kurpiers, Philipp Wagner, Bernd Stannovski, Ljiljana Puskar, Roland Mainz, Daniel Abou-Ras, Thomas Schmidt, Lars Korte, Marcel Roß, Steve Albrecht
- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To improve the uniformity of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite films on textured silicon bottom cells by introducing a $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer to prevent interfacial $\text{Pb}\text{I}_2$ formation.
- **Finding**: X-ray Photoemission Electron Microscopy (XPEEM) and Infrared Scattering-type Scanning Near-field Optical Microscope (IR s-SNOM) revealed that the $\text{CsCl}$ seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation, even in areas with thin hole-transporting material ($\text{MeO-2PACz}$), thereby preventing interfacial $\text{Pb}\text{I}_2$ and leading to larger apparent perovskite grains. This optimized growth resulted in a certified perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell efficiency of $29.7\%$.

**8. [Characteristic ferroelectric domains and their dynamic behavior in ordered $\text{Pb}(\text{Sc}_{1/2}\text{Nb}_{1/2})\text{O}_{3}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22831v1)**
- **Authors**: Hiroshi Nakajima, Satoshi Hiroi, Hirofumi Tsukasaki, Yonghong Bing, Stéphane Grenier, Zuo-Guang Ye, Pierre-Eymeric Janolin, Shigeo Mori
- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the ferroelectric microstructures and dynamic behavior of chemically ordered ferroelectric $\text{Pb}(\text{Sc}_{1/2}\text{Nb}_{1/2})\text{O}_{3}$ ($\text{PSN}$).
- **Finding**: In-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with dark-field imaging revealed unique meandering ferroelectric domains in ordered $\text{PSN}$. Observation showed that electric polarization fluctuates around the [111] direction despite long-range rhombohedral domain formation, resulting in weak relaxor properties. In-situ heating successfully captured the dynamic movement of domain walls and the coexistence of paraelectric-ferroelectric phases near the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition.

**9. [Scalable Synthesis of Large-Area $\text{WS}_2$ Thin Films from Tungsten Precursors by Thermal CVD and Their Application in Schottky-Barrier Solar Cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22063v1)**
- **Authors**: Jisun Kim, Yoosuk Kim, Seung-Ho Park, Yong Hun Ko, Chong-Yun Park
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: To develop a scalable thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy for synthesizing uniform, large-area $\text{WS}_2$ thin films via sulfurization of tungsten precursors and apply them in photovoltaic devices.
- **Finding**: $\text{WS}_2$ films grown at $800^{\circ}\text{C}$ using sputtered W thin films exhibited enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness compared to W foils. Optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) validated the creation of stoichiometric, layered $\text{WS}_2$. Schottky-barrier solar cells fabricated from these films achieved a power conversion efficiency of $1.45\%$.

**10. [Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22002v1)**
- **Authors**: Muxian Xu, Siyu Cheng, Andrea Capa Salinas, Ganesh Pokharel, Alexander LaFleur, Hong Li, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Qinwen Deng, Binghai Yan, Ziqiang Wang, Stephen D. Wilson, Ilija Zeljkovic
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: To determine whether electronic nematicity (rotational symmetry breaking) in the kagome superconductor $\text{Cs}\text{V}_3\text{Sb}_5$ is intrinsically linked to the $2 \times 2$ charge density wave (CDW) or is a pervasive parent state feature.
- **Finding**: Spectroscopic Imaging Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (SI-STM) was used to study doped $\text{Cs}\text{V}_3\text{Sb}_5$ where the CDW was suppressed. Rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure persisted in short-range nanoscale regions across a wide doping range, long after all CDWs were suppressed. This demonstrates ubiquitous electronic nematicity unrelated to the $2 \times 2$ CDW, establishing it as the intrinsic parent state.

- **Date**: 2025-11-25
- **Objective**: To achieve direct, real-space imaging of moiré-confined excitons in twisted bilayer $\text{Mo}\text{S}_2$ with nanometer resolution at room temperature.
- **Finding**: Room-temperature Photocurrent Atomic Force Microscopy (PC-AFM) was employed to image excitons across the moiré superlattice of $2^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer $\text{Mo}\text{S}_2$. The measurements directly resolved site-selective confinement, showing that direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries within the moiré unit cell, providing critical constraints for microscopic models of moiré excitons.

**12. [Imaging Quantum Well States of Dirac Electrons in Exfoliated 3D Topological Insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19581v1)**
- **Authors**: Shreyashi Sinha, Shantanu Pathak, Saswata Bhattacharya, Sujit Manna
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To develop a controlled mechanical exfoliation technique for 3D topological insulators to yield ultrathin flakes suitable for resolving Quantum Well States (QWS) of Dirac electrons.
- **Finding**: Atomically resolved Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize high-quality $(\text{Bi}_{0.1}\text{Sb}_{0.9})_2\text{Te}_3$ flakes. High-resolution Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) revealed clear QWS driven by quantum confinement, which are accurately described by the phase accumulation model. Spatially resolved spectroscopy further confirmed that these QWS remain robust against defect scattering.

**13. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce the concept of "e-coherent" crystalline interfaces, where non-affine transformations lead to enhanced coherency via the introduction of unique line defects termed "discohesions."
- **Finding**: Atomistic simulations and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that local non-affine relaxations introduce additional coincidence sites, resulting in e-coherency. These associated defects, discohesions, lack long-range stress fields and their motion alters the state of coherency. The energetics and kinetics of these interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content, suggesting e-coherency is a pervasive phenomenon in crystalline solids.

**14. [Detecting Linear Dichroism with Atomic Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18796v1)**
- **Authors**: Roger Guzman, Ján Rusz, Ang Li, Juan Carlos Idrobo, Wu Zhou, Jaume Gazquez
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce a versatile electron linear dichroism methodology in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) to achieve atomic-scale investigation of electronic anisotropies and orbital polarization.
- **Finding**: By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) in STEM, the methodology directly visualizes orbital occupation at individual atomic columns. Using strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{Mn}\text{O}_3$ thin films, the $\text{Mn}-3d$ $e_g$ orbital polarization was resolved with sub-angstrom precision, showing that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^2-r^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^2-y^2$.

**15. [Many-body electronic structure in pyrochlore superconductor $\text{Cs}\text{Bi}_2$ and spin liquid $\text{Pr}_2\text{Ir}_2\text{O}_7$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18059v1)**

Kuntscher, Zhiwei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Jia-Xin Yin
- **Date**: 2025-11-22
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale investigation of the many-body electronic structures in the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore materials $\text{Cs}\text{Bi}_2$ (superconductor) and $\text{Pr}_2\text{Ir}_2\text{O}_7$ (spin liquid).
- **Finding**: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at $0.3 \text{ K}$ provided atomically resolved images of the (111) surfaces. In $\text{Cs}\text{Bi}_2$, spectroscopy revealed strong coupling superconductivity ($2\Delta/k_B T_C = 4.7$) and a hexagonal vortex lattice where each core exhibits three-fold symmetry. In $\text{Pr}_2\text{Ir}_2\text{O}_7$, a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance was observed, which displayed a three-fold spatial modulation and atomic site-dependent Zeeman splitting under magnetic field.

**16. [Probing Boundary Spins in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17173v1)**
- **Authors**: Armando A. Aligia, Alejandro M. Lobos, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Claudio J. Gazza
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Objective**: To propose an experimental method for detecting localized spins near the ends of a $\text{Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard}$ chain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR).
- **Finding**: When the STM tip is coupled to the chain end, it realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, resulting in a detectable Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the width of this Kondo resonance as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides a clear signature of the localized boundary spins. Density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations supported the characterization of the spin gap and spin projection of the end states.

**17. [Tungsten doping-induced phase transition in CVD-grown $\text{Mo}\text{S}_2$ bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16758v1)**
- **Authors**: Ana Senkić, Rachael Keneipp, Petra Ivatović, Namrata Pradeep, Vincent Meunier, Marko Kralj, Marija Drndić, Nataša Vujičić
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and characterize a structural phase transition induced by tungsten (W) doping in bilayer $\text{Mo}\text{S}_2$ synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
- **Finding**: Increasing W concentration in $2\text{L}$ $\text{Mo}\text{S}_2$ induces a phase transition from the non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to the centrosymmetric $\text{AB}'$ stacking, evidenced by the vanishing polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) signal and the stiffening of the layer-breathing mode. Aberration Corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (AC-STEM) confirmed the spatial distribution of W concentration and the associated structural changes at the atomic level.

**18. [Quantifying Twist Angles in Cuprate Heterostructures with Anisotropic Raman Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16610v1)**
- **Authors**: Flavia Lo Sardo, Marina Esposito, Tommaso Confalone, Christophe Tremblay, Valerii M. Vinokur, Genda Gu, Domenico Montemurro, Davide Massarotti, Francesco Tafuri, Kornelius Nielsch, Nicola Poccia, Golam Haider
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for accurately determining the twist angle in artificially stacked cuprate heterostructures ($\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{Ca}\text{Cu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, or $\text{BSCCO}$).
- **Finding**: The twist angle in $\text{BSCCO}$ heterostructures was quantified by analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, specifically utilizing the out-of-plane $A_{1g}$ vibrational mode at $116 \text{ cm}^{-1}$. This methodology provides clear optical fingerprints of rotational misalignment, offering a precise and non-invasive alternative to conventional methods like electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques, which can damage the sensitive twisted interface.

**19. [The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material $\text{Ga}\text{Ge}\text{Te}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16474v1)**
- **Authors**: Qiao Wang, Ping-An Hu
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To report the discovery of high plasticity in the ternary germanium-based single-crystal $\text{Ga}\text{Ge}\text{Te}$ and elucidate the underlying deformation mechanism.
- **Finding**: $\text{Ga}\text{Ge}\text{Te}$ exhibits high plasticity, overcoming the inherent brittleness of traditional germanium-based chalcogenides. Spherical aberration-corrected Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) experiments, combined with DFT calculations, revealed a novel deformation mechanism co-dominated by intralayer lattice distortion and interlayer slip, highlighting the critical role of intralayer structural evolution in the plastic behavior.

- **Authors**: Neil Mulcahy, Syeda Ramin Jannat, Yaqi Li, Tigran Simonian, Mariana Palos, James O. Douglas, Jessica M. Walker, Baptiste Gault, Mary P. Ryan, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To provide a mechanistic understanding of phase transformations and interfacial chemistry in Pt-based alloying anodes during lithiation using a correlative framework of operando X-ray spectroscopy and high-resolution cryogenic microscopy.
- **Finding**: The initial lithiation forms $\text{Li}_2\text{Pt}$, evolving into stable $\text{Li}\text{Pt}$ via a solid solution reaction. Cryogenic Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) transitions to a stable $\text{LiF}$-dominated composition. Crucially, cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed nanoscale compositional gradients within the alloy, rationalizing the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism based on kinetic limitations and interface dynamics.

**21. [Synthetic Spatiotemporal Plasmonic Vortices On Chip](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16155v1)**
- **Authors**: Qian Chen, Shuoshuo Zhang, Guoyu Xian, Haoqiang Hu, Xiaohua Wu, Xiaofei Wu, Jer-Shing Huang, Chen-Bin Huang, Jin-Hui Zhong, Yuquan Zhang, Xiaocong Yuan, Changjun Min, Yanan Dai
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize a new class of polychromatic modes, Spatiotemporal Plasmonic Vortices (STPVs), carrying nontrivial topological spin textures, generated by chronotopic interference on a chip.
- **Finding**: STPVs were generated by the interference of temporally delayed plasmonic eigen-vortices. Interferometric Time-Resolved Photoemission Electron Microscopy (ITR-PEEM) was used to directly image the nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution of these vortices and allowed for control over the vortex number and position, establishing STPVs as a platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter.

- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To comprehensively investigate the structural and superconducting properties of high-quality single-crystalline $\text{Bi}\text{Pt}$ to determine its pairing symmetry and superconducting mechanism.
- **Finding**: $\text{Bi}\text{Pt}$ is established as a weak type-II superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_c$) of $1.2 \text{ K}$, exhibiting anisotropic characteristics consistent with its hexagonal crystal structure. Electron microscopy confirmed the high quality of the single crystals, and $\mu \text{SR}$ and heat capacity data indicated conventional s-wave superconductivity that maintains time-reversal symmetry.

Key findings include the direct visualization of charge density modulations associated with the spatially modulated PDW order parameter, confirming the existence of this unconventional superconducting state.

- **Authors**: Hao Zhang, Hui Chen, Zichen Huang, Zi-Ang Wang, Senhao Lv, Guoyu Xian, Hui Guo, Haitao Yang, Hong-Jun Gao
- **Date**: 2025-11-19
- **Objective**: To explore the modulation of superconducting vortex bound states by the unidirectional Charge Density Wave (CDW) order in the transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor $1\text{T}''-\text{Nb}\text{Te}_2$.
- **Finding**: Ultra-low-temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy (STM/STS) revealed a stripe-like $3 \times 1 \times 3$ unidirectional CDW coexisting with superconductivity. Applied magnetic fields induced elliptical vortices elongated along the CDW stripes. Crucially, CDW domain boundaries caused abrupt changes in vortex orientation and vortex bound states, establishing a novel mechanism for manipulating superconducting vortex states via CDW coupling.

**25. [Integrating Atomic Scale Catalyst Design with Transport Engineering for Stable and Efficient $\text{CO}_2$ Electrolysis to $\text{CO}$ in a Membrane Electrode Assembly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15042v1)**
- **Authors**: Zahra Teimouri, Mahtab Masouminia, Ashkan Irannezhad, Reza Eslami, Joseph Deering, Navid Noor, Shunquan Tan, Amirhossein Foroozan, Shayan Angizi, Sung-Fu Hun, Drew Higgins
- **Date**: 2025-11-19
- **Objective**: To develop a stable and efficient atomically dispersed $\text{Ni}$-$\text{N}$-$\text{C}$ catalyst for $\text{CO}_2$ electrolysis in a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) by integrating atomic design with transport engineering.
- **Finding**: The $\text{Ni-NCNT}$ electrode (using carbon nanotubes) achieved a high partial current density ($558 \text{ mA} \text{ cm}^{-2}$) and stable operation for over $210 \text{ hours}$. Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography was used to generate 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers. Simulations based on these images demonstrated that the superior performance of $\text{Ni-NCNT}$ is due to improved $\text{CO}_2$ diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution compared to carbon black supports.

**26. [Secondary electron topographical contrast formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14491v1)**
- **Authors**: Evgenii Vlasov, Wouter Heyvaert, Tom Stoops, Sandra Van Aert, Johan Verbeeck, Sara Bals
- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To propose an analytical physical model explaining secondary electron (SE) topographical contrast formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), accounting for SE emission and interaction with the TEM objective magnetic field.
- **Finding**: An analytical physical model was developed that accurately describes the physics of SE emission and their interaction with the magnetic field within the objective lens. This model enables more reliable interpretation of surface-sensitive, pseudo-3D topographic information obtained via SE imaging in STEM, laying the foundation for novel 3D surface reconstruction algorithms.

**27. [Two-component anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in anisotropic Fe$_{4-x}$Ge$_x$N thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14305v1)**
- **Authors**: R. K. Paul, J. Vít, P. Levinský, J. Hejtmánek, O. Kaman, M. Pashchenko, L. Kubíčková, K. Ahn, M. Jarošová, J. More Chevalier, S. Cichoň, T. Kmječ, J. Kohout, M. Hans, S. Mráz, J. M. Schneider, E. Adabifiroozjaei, L. Molina-Luna, O. Gutfleisch, I. Dirba, K. Knížek
- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: To systematically analyze the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in anisotropic $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{N}$ thin films and correlate them with structural and magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: The films with high Ge content ($x=0.8$ and $x=1$) displayed unusual two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects, resulting from the co-existence of two crystallographic orientations (a-axis and c-axis normal to the film surface) and opposite signs of the anomalous effects along these axes. Electron microscopy confirmed the structural transition from cubic $\text{Fe}_4\text{N}$ to a slightly tetragonal phase for $x>0.35$, supporting the structural anisotropy responsible for the observed magnetotransport phenomena.

**28. [Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13917v1)**
- **Authors**: Anand Ithepalli, Saumya Vashishtha, Naomi Pieczulewski, Qiao Liu, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Matthew Barone, Darrell Schlom, David A. Muller, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Objective**: To investigate how the miscut angle of c-plane sapphire substrates influences the structural quality, critical thickness, and superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) of MBE-grown $\text{NbN}$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle up to $10^\circ$ significantly improved the structural quality of the $\text{NbN}$ films, evidenced by a reduction in the X-ray diffraction rocking curve FWHM from $76~\text{arcsecs}$ to $20~\text{arcsecs}$. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images determined that the critical thickness for the onset of columnar growth is approximately $10~\text{nm}$, independent of the substrate miscut. This improved structural quality correlated with a marginal increase in $T_\text{c}$ from $12.1~\text{K}$ to $12.5~\text{K}$.

- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To identify the underlying mechanism by which certain refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) exhibit enhanced high-temperature strength, specifically focusing on dislocation dynamics.

This effect drives a gradual mechanistic transition from screw-dislocation-controlled to edge-dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was crucial in characterizing the microstructural changes and dislocation behavior supporting this transition.

- **Authors**: Simon Hettler, Raul Arenal
- **Date**: 2025-11-11

- **Objective**: To investigate the microscopic structure and local influence of regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze ferroelectric material $\text{Sr}_2\text{NaNb}_5\text{O}_{15}$.
- **Finding**: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the stacking faults, defined by a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four, resulting in four distinct domains corresponding to the directions of the $S_3$ order parameter (related to $\text{NbO}_6$ octahedral tilts). Force-field calculations estimated the stacking fault energy to be $46~\text{mJ}/\text{m}^2$. The study concluded that these faults significantly affect the local polar modes, suggesting a strong influence on the material's ferroelectric properties.
