**1. [The Microscopic Structure of Stacking Faults in Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06983v1)**
- **Authors**: Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland
- **Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the microscopic structure and influence of regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that regular stacking faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four, leading to the emergence of four possible domains related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was crucial for observing and characterizing these faults, while force-field calculations estimated the stacking fault energy and suggested their placement at positions of similar octahedral rotation. The investigation showed that these faults significantly affect the local polar modes, potentially influencing the material's ferroelectric properties.

- **Authors**: Lukas Flajsman, Lars Peeters, Armi Kosunen, Lide Yao, Ionela Vrejoiu, Sebastiaan van Dijken
- **Date**: 2025-11-09
- **Objective**: To investigate the epitaxial growth and characterize the magnetic and structural properties of Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Er:YIG) films for hybrid optomagnonic devices.
- **Finding**: X-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed single-phase, fully coherent growth with atomically sharp interfaces across the entire substitution range. Magnetometry revealed a gradual decrease in saturation magnetization with increasing Er content, consistent with antiparallel coupling, and the emergence of an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Films with low Er content ($x=0.008$) retained nearly isotropic magnetization and low damping, identifying growth conditions that preserve YIG's low-loss magnetic properties while introducing optical functionality.

- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Objective**: To achieve gigapixel space-bandwidth products at video rates using ptychography by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations through neural field representations.
- **Finding**: The developed approach factorizes the space-time volume into low-rank spatial and temporal features using dual networks and a gradient-domain loss, enabling video-rate gigapixel imaging with centimeter-scale coverage while resolving 308-nm linewidths. This method transforms temporal variations from a constraint into exploitable correlations, making gigapixel video tractable with single-sensor measurements. This establishes ptychography as a high-throughput sensing tool for monitoring mesoscale dynamics without lenses, demonstrated across various applications from crystals to biological samples and extreme ultraviolet experiments.

**5. [Compressive multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05864v1)**
- **Authors**: Akira Yasuhara, Takumi Sannomiya, Ryoichi Horisaki
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging technique that integrates down-sampling with super-resolution image reconstruction via a compressive sensing framework.
- **Finding**: A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes was used to produce a multi-beam STEM probe. Despite the overlapping patterns in raw multi-beam images, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yielded high-fidelity images that closely reproduced the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. This proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multi-beam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction, potentially useful for analytical scanning methods in general.

- **Date**: 2025-11-07
- **Objective**: To analyze the magnetic properties of the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ and refine its crystal structure and stacking-fault model.
- **Finding**: By analyzing powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization data, the study showed that Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings, in contrast to previously proposed models. X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound, revealing a different magnetic coupling scheme ($J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$) where inter-layer coupling ($J_4$) is dominant.

- **Authors**: Joshua Renner, Matthew A. Wright, Kristofer Bouchard, Bruce E. Cohen, Peter Ercius, Azriel Goldschmidt, Cassio C. S. Pedroso, Ambarneil Saha, Peter Denes
- **Date**: 2025-11-06
- **Objective**: To develop a new, robust method called Back-Propagation Counting (BPC) for electron counting in direct electron detectors, particularly at high electron fluence.
- **Finding**: BPC, utilizing machine learning techniques without requiring large training datasets, was shown to accurately count multiple electron strikes per pixel and maintain robustness to increasing occupancy in synthetic data. In experimental data, frames counted with BPC reconstructed diffraction peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with higher intensity and produced images with improved contrast compared to a standard counting method. These results demonstrate BPC's effectiveness in high-flux electron microscopy experiments, such as in situ TEM movies and diffraction.

- **Authors**: Henry C. Hammer, Caleb Whittier, Nathan A. Helvy, Christopher Rouleau, Nabil D. Bassim, Ravitej Uppu
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the controlled low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates for hybrid quantum photonic interfaces.
- **Finding**: Controlled surface preparation, involving an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer, enabled the epitaxial growth of anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390°C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that higher growth temperatures or oxide desorption led to rough, polycrystalline rutile films. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verified the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions, establishing a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources.

**10. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part II - COMSOL Simulation and Apparatus Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03821v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of irregular crystallization in ZBLAN glass under vibration, attributed to intermittent thermal contact, through finite element modeling and experimental validation with an apparatus redesign.
- **Finding**: COMSOL Multiphysics simulations confirmed that intermittent contact, caused by vibration, significantly reduced heat transfer efficiency and lowered the sample temperature. A redesigned experimental setup with a four-degree inclination successfully maintained stable contact during vibration, leading to uniform heating and consistent crystallization behavior. Comprehensive microscopic, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses revealed that vibration accelerates nucleation, enhances heat transfer, and reduces the effective fiber-drawing temperature window by about 30°C, promoting unwanted phase transitions above 330°C.

**11. [Single photon emitters in hBN: Limitations of atomic resolution imaging and potential sources of error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03674v1)**
- **Authors**: David Lamprecht, Shrirang Chokappa, Alissa M. Freilinger, Barbara Maria Mayer, Maximilian Melchior, Jana Dzíbelová, Darwin Lorber, Luiz H. G. Tizei, Mathieu Kociak, Clemens Mangler, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the limitations of atomic resolution imaging, specifically annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM), for identifying single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and potential sources of error.
- **Finding**: STEM image simulations and experiments demonstrated that due to hBN's intrinsic AA' stacking, intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic layers (ca. 6 nm). The study further showed that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial contrast differences, resulting in misidentification of atomic defects. This highlights the unreliability of atomic-scale defect detection in hBN flakes typically used in photonic studies.

**12. [Super-resolution Optical Near-field EM for bio- and materials science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03597v1)**
- **Authors**: Ilia Zykov, Guido Stam, Hanieh Jafarian, Amin Moradi, Peter Neu, Rudolf Tromp, Mariana Amaro, Thomas Juffmann, Sense van der Molen
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To introduce Optical Near-field Electron Microscopy (ONEM) as a non-invasive, label-free imaging technique capable of combining high spatial and temporal resolution.
- **Finding**: ONEM converts optical near-field intensity patterns into photoelectron emission, achieving 31 nm spatial and sub-second temporal resolution using low-energy electron microscopy without exposing the sample to electrons, thus preserving structural and functional integrity. The versatility of ONEM was demonstrated across three distinct domains: imaging polarization-dependent plasmon modes in metal nanostructures, visualizing live *Escherichia coli* in liquid with orientation-resolved contrast in 3D, and capturing real-time electrodeposition of copper nanoclusters from solution, establishing it as a platform for damage-free super-resolution imaging of interface dynamics.

**13. [Emergence of Ferromagnetism from Planar Defects in EuSn2As2 Antiferromagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03582v1)**
- **Authors**: A. Yu. Levakhova, A. L. Vasiliev, N. S. Pavlov, A. V. Ovcharov, V. I. Bondarenko, A. V. Sadakov, K. S. Pervakov, V. A. Vlasenko, V. M. Pudalov
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To study the nano-scale structural peculiarities of the antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn$_2$As$_2$ and explain their role in its puzzling magnetic properties.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed the presence of planar defects within the EuSn$_2$As$_2$ lattice. Through a combination of microstructural and DFT analysis, it was demonstrated that these single planar nano-defects form a layer of a distinct EuSnAs$_2$ phase, where a smaller distance between Eu layers promotes local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of Eu atoms. These planar defects collectively form a weak ferromagnetic phase within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) host, explaining several puzzling magnetic features observed in A-type AFM materials, such as nonlinear magnetization and ferromagnetic-type hysteresis in low fields.

**14. [Posterior corrections for systematic distortions in atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01940v1)**
- **Authors**: Tyler Bortel, Peter Moeck
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Objective**: To develop and demonstrate a posterior algorithmic method for correcting systematic distortions and restoring broken symmetries in atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals.
- **Finding**: The study showed that numerically quantified restorations of symmetries, achieved through information theory-based methods, can effectively correct distortions introduced by imaging processes. The efficacy of this new posterior correction method was demonstrated using thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS$_2$), which were obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy. The method successfully reduced symmetry breaking, providing a robust correction for imaging-induced distortions.

- **Authors**: Tatiana Kochetkova, Stephanie M. Ribet, Lilian M. Vogl, Daniele Casari, Rohan Dhall, Philippe K. Zysset, Andrew M. Minor, Peter Schweizer
- **Date**: 2025-11-02
- **Objective**: To propose a novel approach for extracting and characterizing individual mineralized collagen fibrils (MCFs) from bone using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to understand their structural organization and mechanical properties.
- **Finding**: A novel dropcasting procedure allowed for the isolation of individual MCFs onto TEM-compatible substrates, enabling nanoscale visualization of the arrangement of organic and mineral phases. A 4D-STEM approach was utilized to examine the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs. Furthermore, first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments revealed exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and the mechanical behavior of MCFs and opening new avenues for bio-inspired material design.

**16. [Atomic-Scale Roughness of Freestanding Oxide Membranes Revealed by Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00458v1)**
- **Authors**: Huaicheng Yuan, Yu-Chen Liu, Li-Shu Wang, Zehao Dong, Jan-Chi Yang, Zhen Chen
- **Date**: 2025-11-01
- **Objective**: To develop a metrological approach using electron ptychography to achieve atomic-scale precision in mapping the topography of free surfaces and buried interfaces within ultrathin freestanding oxide heterostructures.
- **Finding**: The developed method reconstructs three-dimensional structures from multislice electron ptychography, allowing atomic-scale precision in mapping topography and counting atoms, including light elements like oxygen, along the electron trajectory. This capability enabled the identification of surface termination in oxide films and provided remarkably rich information and high statistics about atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities in freestanding membranes. This quantitative analysis offers unprecedented capabilities for correlating structural imperfection with quantum device performance, critical for engineering robust heterointerfaces in next-generation oxide electronics.

**17. [Quantifying the Full Damage Profile of Focused Ion Beams via 4D-STEM Precession Electron Diffraction and PSNR Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00320v1)**
- **Authors**: M. G. Masteghin, Z. P. Aslam, A. P. Brown, M. J. Whiting, S. K. Clowes, R. P. Webb, D. C. Cox
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To quantify the full damage profile, including the often-overlooked beam tail, of focused ion beams (FIBs) using 4D-STEM precession electron diffraction and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics.
- **Finding**: The study utilized 4D-STEM with convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. Cross-correlation using PSNR revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artifacts than conventional dark-field imaging. This approach provides a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB performance beyond conventional resolution metrics focused solely on the beam core.

**18. [Interface-mediated softening and deformation mechanics in amorphous/ amorphous nanolaminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00213v1)**
- **Authors**: Vivek Devulapalli, Fedor F. Klimashin, Manuel Bärtschi, Stephan Waldner, Silvia Schwyn Thöny, Johann Michler, Xavier Maeder
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To examine the nanoindentation hardness and deformation behavior of amorphous-amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ nanolaminates with varying bilayer thicknesses.
- **Finding**: Hardness decreased with reduced bilayer thickness, from 7.7 GPa at 334 nm to 5.5 GPa at 2 nm spacing, contrasting with the strengthening observed in crystalline systems. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that fine bilayer spacings promoted closely spaced vertical shear bands with bilayer compression, while coarser spacings showed fewer, widely spaced shear bands with chemical intermixing. Scanning electron diffraction mapping demonstrated significant densification beneath indents, indicating that the high interface density facilitates strain accommodation and prevents the catastrophic failure typical of brittle amorphous materials.

**19. [Synthesis of organic-inorganic perovskite and all-inorganic lead-free double perovskite nanocrystals by femtosecond laser pulses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27563v1)**
- **Authors**: Volodymyr Vasylkovskyi, Andrey Evlyukhin, Elena Schlein, Mykola Slipchenko, Roman Kiyan, Kestutis Kurselis, Vladimir Dyakonov, Boris Chichkov
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To present a novel, ligand-free approach for synthesizing organic-inorganic and all-inorganic lead-free double perovskite nanocrystals using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in ambient air.
- **Finding**: The method successfully produced high-purity, ligand-free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with average sizes up to 100 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction confirmed the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX$_3$ forming larger (approximately 90 nm) cubic NCs and Cs$_2$AgBiX$_6$ forming smaller (approximately 10 nm) rounded NCs. Photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed pronounced size-dependent blue shifts (17-40 nm) due to quantum confinement. This clean, scalable PLA approach provides direct access to high-purity NCs with tunable optical properties, advancing the fabrication of nanostructures for optoelectronic and quantum devices.

**20. [Wrinkle-Induced Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanochannels for Biomolecule Localization and Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26370v1)**
- **Authors**: Xiliang Yang, Tetsuo Martynowicz, Allard Katan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Sabina Caneva
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can act as self-assembled nanochannels for biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy.
- **Finding**: Scalable and reproducible wrinkle networks were obtained by controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties. Structural characterization using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the morphology, while fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy confirmed that aqueous solutions stably filled the nanochannels. Selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging were achieved in these one-dimensional channels through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure, where the graphene overlayer served as a quenching mask. This provides a scalable, lithography-free route for planar nanofluidic confinements compatible with single-molecule imaging.

**21. [Incoherent dielectric tensor tomography for quantitative 3D measurement of biaxial anisotropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26348v1)**
- **Authors**: Juheon Lee, Yeon Wook Kim, Hwanseok Chang, Herve Hugonnet, Seung-Mo Hong, Seokwoo Jeon, YongKeun Park
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
- **Objective**: To introduce incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT), a non-interferometric optical imaging method, for quantitatively reconstructing the 3D dielectric tensor and measuring biaxial anisotropy.
- **Finding**: iDTT combines polarization diversity and angular-spectrum modulation to achieve speckle-free and vibration-robust mapping of biaxial birefringence with submicron resolution. Validated through simulations and experiments on uniaxial and biaxial samples, iDTT demonstrated quantitative accuracy. Applied to mixed and polycrystalline materials, it distinguished crystal types by their birefringent properties and revealed 3D grain orientations and boundaries. Unlike X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, iDTT provides a practical, accessible, quantitative, and label-free tool for characterizing biaxial anisotropy in diverse materials without specialized facilities or destructive preparation.

**22. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part I -- Experimental Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25748v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley, Ujjwal Dhakal
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the influence of mechanical vibration on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN glass under normal gravity conditions.
- **Finding**: Experiments using a controlled heating and vibration apparatus showed that vibration reduces the crystallization onset temperature, indicating enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) corroborated these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale roughness in crystallized regions and confirming that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a purely thermal effect.

- **Authors**: Antonin Louiset, Daniel Förster, Vincent Jourdain, Saïd Tahir, Nicola Vigano, Jean-Luc Rouvière, Christophe Bichara, Hanako Okuno
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in the structural analysis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).
- **Finding**: Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, 4D-STEM enabled rapid acquisition of low-noise electron diffraction patterns, allowing precise determination of the local chirality of multiple nanotubes simultaneously with limited electron dose (down to 1750 e-/$\text{\AA}^2$) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). The approach also enabled tracking chirality along a single nanotube and accessing strain distribution. Furthermore, 4D-STEM data facilitated the reconstruction of high-resolution images with electron ptychography, providing atomic-scale spatial resolution for imaging atomic defects, with multi-slice electron ptychography offering potential for 3D defect structure insights.

**24. [Optimizing probes for multi-beam ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24542v1)**
- **Authors**: Runqing Yang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez, Maik Kahnt
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: To present a quantitative framework for assessing and optimizing probe sets for multi-beam ptychography (MBP) based on separability, uniformity, and fabrication feasibility.
- **Finding**: The quantitative framework demonstrated that Hadamard-based binary phase masks consistently outperformed other probe designs (Zernike polynomials, experimentally feasible phase plates, and spiral phase masks) across varying scan densities. These masks led to more robust and scalable MBP reconstructions. While spiral masks yielded comparable resolution, they scaled less efficiently due to increased structural complexity. The results establish practical criteria for evaluating and designing structured probes, enabling more robust and scalable implementation of MBP in high-throughput coherent X-ray and EUV imaging.

**25. [Noise Estimation and Suppression in Quantitative EMCD Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24445v1)**
- **Authors**: Hitoshi Makino, Bernd Rellinghaus, Sebastian Schneider, Axel Lubk, Darius Pohl
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: To present a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) measurements in transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: The study systematically analyzed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy channels using bootstrap statistics on long-term acquired electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) from Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. A robust energy alignment procedure minimized systematic errors from energy misalignment. Variance-to-mean analysis revealed that detector-amplified shot noise is the dominant noise source. The methodology recommends a stricter SNR threshold for reliable EMCD detection and quantification, ensuring critical spectral features meet requirements for quantitative analysis, and provides a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary for valid measurements.

- **Authors**: Robert G. Radloff, Felix F. Zimmermann, Siqi Li, Stephan Kuschel, Anatoli Ulmer, Yanwen Sun, Takahiro Sato, Peihao Sun, Johann Haber, Diling Zhu, Miklós Tegze, Gyula Faigel, Matthew R. Ware, Jordan T. O'Neal, Jumpei Yamada, Taito Osaka, Robert Zierold, Carina Hedrich, Dimitrios Kazazis, Yasin Ekinci, Makina Yabashi, Ichiro Inoue, Andrew Aquila, Meng Liang, Agostino Marinelli, Tais Gorkhover
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: To develop a lensless 3D imaging method for non-periodic, stationary objects using X-ray fluorescence intensity correlations, thereby eliminating the need for extensive sample rotations.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that X-ray fluorescence intensity correlations, excited by ultrashort X-ray pulses, contain 3D structural information of non-periodic objects. By illuminating a vanadium foil with a sub-200 nm X-ray laser beam and recording 16 distinct specimen projections from different detector regions without changing sample orientation, the researchers confirmed that FEL-induced fluorescence reflects real-space structural changes. This establishes a new approach for lensless 3D imaging, offering a significant advantage over coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) methods that typically require extensive sample rotation.

**27. [Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moirés](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042v1)**
- **Authors**: Harikrishnan KP, Xin Wei, Chia-Hao Lee, Dasol Yoon, Yonghun Lee, Kevin J. Crust, Yu-Tsun Shao, Ruijuan Xu, Jong-Hoon Kang, Ce Liang, Jiwoong Park, Harold Y. Hwang, David A. Muller
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Objective**: To investigate and characterize the morphology of buried interfaces in twisted oxide moiré systems, identifying challenges in achieving atomic-level coupling due to surface roughness.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that topographic mismatch due to surface roughness significantly restricts atomic-scale proximity at interfaces in twisted oxide membranes, even after eliminating contaminants. Cross-sectional imaging, particularly electron ptychography, was crucial for characterizing the interface morphology, reliably resolving structural variations on the order of a nanometer. In contrast, conventional through-focal imaging in projection was found to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for oxide twistronics and emphasize the necessity of advanced electron microscopy for reliable characterization.

**28. [Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320v1)**
- **Authors**: Tim Titze, Sabri Koraltan, Timo Schmidt, Mailin Matthies, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Dieter Suess, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil
- **Date**: 2025-10-24
- **Objective**: To demonstrate precise control over the order and dynamics of bubble and skyrmion lattices in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers by engineering their initial stripe domain configurations using in-plane magnetic fields.
- **Finding**: The research showed that applying a brief in-plane "set" magnetic field to the stripe domain state significantly enhances both the frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and magnetic force microscopy (MFM), complemented by micromagnetic simulations, revealed that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon subsequent out-of-plane field application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. This method enables precise control of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond timescales and potentially of topology.

**30. [Boron Nitride Coatings for the Enhanced Detection of Neutrons in CR-39](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20924v1)**
- **Authors**: Noah DAmico, Sandeep Puri, Ian Jones, Andrew Gillespie, Cuikun Lin, Bo Zhao, R. V. Duncan
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To assess and enhance the neutron detection efficiency of CR-39 nuclear track detectors by developing and applying a boron nitride (BN) coating.
- **Finding**: A boron nitride (BN) coating was developed for CR-39 detectors to enhance neutron detection efficiency by converting neutrons into energetic alpha particles through the well-known $^10$B(n,$\alpha$)$^7$Li reaction. Partially coated CR-39 pieces were exposed to AmBe, $^{252}$Cf, and D-T (14 MeV) neutron sources. Subsequently, large-area Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging over the irradiated area, alongside optical microscopy, was used to evaluate the detection efficiency (tracks per neutron) for each source spectrum, both with and without the BN coating, confirming the enhancement provided by the coating.

**31. [Sub-10 nm Quantification of Spin and Orbital Magnetic Moment Across the Metamagnetic Phase Transition in FeRh Using EMCD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20523v1)**
- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Veronica Leccese, Ján Rusz, Jon Ander Arregi, Alexey Sapozhnik, Jáchym Štindl, Francesco Barantani, Paolo Cattaneo, Antoine Andrieux, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Fabrizio Carbone, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate the quantitative accuracy limits of electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for measuring element-specific spin and orbital magnetic moments at sub-10 nm spatial resolution, particularly across the magnetostructural transition in FeRh.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that the extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) from EMCD measurements in FeRh remains consistent with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$ was observed, attributed to instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity. These results confirm that EMCD provides quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments in functional magnetic materials, allowing the study of interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible to photon-based methods.

**32. [Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517v2)**
- **Authors**: M. J. Adriaans, J. P. Hoogenboom, A. Mohammadi-Gheidari
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To propose a cost-effective and simpler design for an electrostatic electron monochromator for electron microscopy, addressing the high cost and operational complexity of current devices.
- **Finding**: Through a thin-deflector analysis, the study demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of current monochromators, which use homogeneous-field deflectors, to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections, often necessitating additional correcting elements. In contrast, a fringe-field deflector was shown to be less sensitive to these issues. A cost-effective and simple monochromator design approach based on pure fringe fields is proposed, which does not require extra correcting elements and achieves optimal energy resolution by including momentary deceleration lenses. This fully electrostatic design could be realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies in electron microscopes.

- **Authors**: Léon F. Schröder, Sabrina Weber, Lukas Fuchs, Volker Schmidt, Benedikt Prifling
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To develop a novel approach for predicting the 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes from more easily accessible 2D Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images, thereby overcoming the limitations of costly 3D acquisition methods.
- **Finding**: The proposed method utilizes a low-parametric 3D model from stochastic geometry to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures, and employs a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain the corresponding 2D SEM images. By systematically varying the underlying model parameters, a large dataset is generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling statistical reconstruction of the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images. An error analysis on key geometrical descriptors quantitatively evaluated the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool, demonstrating its potential to significantly reduce the time and resources needed for microstructural characterization.

- **Date**: 2025-10-21
- **Objective**: To elucidate the mechanisms by which oxygen interstitial alloying in additively manufactured titanium enhances both strength and ductility, focusing on the role of atomic-scale lattice defects.
- **Finding**: Using quasi-3D imaging based on multi-slice electron ptychography, the study revealed a high density of a new type of interstitial-character lattice defect, namely zero-dimensional stacking domains (ZDSDs), in AM-processed oxygen-modulated pure titanium. These ZDSDs promote slip diversity and support intense work hardening, enabling a three-fold enhancement in both strength and ductility in Ti-0.45O compared to conventional pure Ti. The work demonstrates the potential for using interstitial solutes to enhance mechanical properties and highlights the critical role of advanced electron microscopy in revealing these atomic-scale defects.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate sub-unit cell engineering of epitaxial CrVO$_3$ superlattice thin films with atomic-scale accuracy using layer-by-layer growth, and to stabilize the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$.
- **Finding**: The study successfully fabricated epitaxial CrVO$_3$ superlattice thin films, precisely controlling the periodic arrangement of Cr and V layers at the sub-unit cell scale (alternating 3, 2, or 1 single atomic layers of Cr$_2$O$_3$ and V$_2$O$_3$). X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed this thickness control and the stabilization of the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$ (space group R-3) for the first time. This novel approach to the growth of ordered corundum oxides opens the path towards the stabilization of new complex oxides with tailored properties by varying the composition and the superlattice period, ultimately broadening the family of functional rhombohedral oxides.

Density functional theory calculations confirmed the chemical potential-driven stabilization of Laves phase lamellae. The study proposed a defect landscape for $\mu$-phases, illustrating the interplay between site occupancy, dislocation types, and planar faults across the chemical potential space, providing fundamental insights into defect engineering through chemical tuning.

**39. [Structured Random Phase Retrieval using Optical Diffusers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14490v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Hu, Fakhriyya Mammadova, Julián Tachella, Michael Unser, Jonathan Dong
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Objective**: To propose structured random models for phase retrieval that emulate dense random matrices using a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices, aiming to reduce computational costs while maintaining reconstruction performance.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that structured random models can achieve the same reconstruction performance as dense random models, but with complexity reduced from quadratic to log-linear. Robust reconstruction was obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8 using a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent. The performance was found to be solely determined by the singular value distribution of the forward matrix. This class of models can be directly implemented with basic optical elements like lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees in various modalities, including electron microscopy.

- **Authors**: Yueyun Chen, Xin Yi Ling, Jared Lodico, Tristan P. O`Neill, B. C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Objective**: To demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh) as a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures by detecting local volumetric lattice changes.
- **Finding**: KDTh precisely fits Kikuchi patterns to detect local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline samples, allowing temperature changes to be deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The study mapped lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe across the sample, achieving a parameter precision of $\sim$0.01% and a temperature sensitivity of 2.2 K/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. KDTh, which can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes, offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission electron microscopy.

- **Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Objective**: To develop a scalable and deterministic process for constructing heterostrain-induced moiré superlattices in 2D materials using patterned thin-film stressors.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated the construction of moiré superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenides by applying patterned thin-film stressors. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to directly resolve the induced heterostrain, lattice deformations, and stacking variations that produce the moiré superlattice. Uniaxial and biaxial heterostrain were found to create distinct moiré patterns, including stripes and distorted hexagonal patterns, leading to in-plane polar distortions and thus in-plane polarization at the domain boundaries of the moiré superlattice in MoS$_2$. This approach opens opportunities to design new moiré geometries in 2D materials using a well-established scalable process.

- **Date**: 2025-10-15
- **Objective**: To investigate the surface properties of Ga-Cu based liquid metal alloys, particularly the impact of Cu dilution topography and reaction conditions, for their potential in supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS).
- **Finding**: X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and Machine-Learned-Force Field (ML-FF) calculations revealed a shift of the Cu 2p core level to higher binding energies and a narrowed d-band with decreasing Cu content, attributed to site isolation. XPS measurements between 100 and 500 $^\circ$C showed a Cu 2p shift to lower binding energies, tentatively ascribed to changes in the local environment with increasing temperature (bond elongation), corroborated by ML-FF simulations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images evidenced crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds at low temperatures, explaining the increased Cu surface content. These insights may pave the way for an insight-driven development of low-temperature melting liquid metals for heterogeneous catalysis.

- **Finding**: The study successfully grew AlScN thin films by MOCVD, showing controllable scandium (Sc) incorporation up to $\sim$13% using (MCp)$_2$ScCl as a precursor. AlScN/AlN/GaN heterostructures exhibited the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel at the AlScN/AlN–GaN interface, confirming their potential for HEMT device technologies. Thicker AlScN/AlN barriers yielded higher sheet charge densities ($5.22 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ for $\sim$30 nm barrier). High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) further confirmed Sc incorporation and revealed the wurtzite crystalline structure of the films and heterostructures, establishing MOCVD as a promising method for advancing III-nitride heterostructures.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed their orthorhombic crystal structure. A combination of absorption and laser excited fluorescence performed on samples cooled to 10 K allowed for the determination of 56 experimental crystal-field levels. A parametrized crystal-field analysis for Sm$^{3+}$ in the C$_{\rm s}$ point group symmetry centers of K$_2$YF$_5$ yielded a good approximation to the experimental data.

- **Date**: 2025-10-13
- **Objective**: To enhance the plasmonic hotspot density and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance of multi-layered MoO$_3$-Ag-Au substrates through ion-beam engineering.
- **Finding**: Orthorhombic $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ microflakes were coated with Ag (5 nm) and Au (5 nm) thin films and then irradiated with 100 MeV Ag$^{8+}$ swift heavy ions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) elucidated that irradiation caused dewetting of metal films, leading to the formation of dispersed Ag-Au nanoparticles, enhanced surface roughness, and defect generation within the MoO$_3$ lattice. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) disclosed vibrational alterations and binding-energy shifts in Mo 3d, indicative of oxygen vacancies ($V_\text{O}$) and partial reduction of Mo. SERS measurements of molecular probes demonstrated significantly increased Raman intensities following ion irradiation, confirming the enhancement of plasmonic hotspot density via structural engineering.

The model demonstrated strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines. The LLM acts as a reasoning engine and intelligent assistant, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images.

- **Finding**: The study developed an improved pixel-wise gain and nonlinearity calibration method based on the backside pulsing technique, generating a three-dimensional lookup table for all pixels across the full dynamic range. This method yielded negligible deviations between calibrated and nominal energies for photons and electrons, improving energy resolution by 4% to 22% for 15-25 keV photons and from 16% to 23% for 60-200 keV electrons compared to conventional linear calibration. Deep learning-based electron localization demonstrated a 4% improvement in spatial resolution using this proposed calibration method, further enhancing detector performance for electron microscopy.

This diagram revealed distinct regimes, including the growth of layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide GaSe with an unstrained in-plane lattice constant of 0.371$\pm$0.001 nm and a partial epitaxial alignment on sapphire. This work demonstrates a RHEED-based pathway for synthesizing gallium selenide of specific phase and morphology, and the constructed phase diagram can be applied to a wide range of other metal chalcogenide materials.

- **Authors**: Damian Brzozowski, Yu Liu, Karola Neeleman, Magnus Nord, Ingrid G. Hallsteinsen
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Objective**: To achieve precise growth control of highly textured Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films on SrTiO$_3$ substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and investigate the influence of growth parameters on film stoichiometry, morphology, and crystalline quality.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that careful selection of temperature and pressure during PLD allows manipulation of film stoichiometry between direct target transfer and tellurium-deficient phases. Optimized PLD enabled the growth of films with coalesced, faceted grains with grain sizes reaching up to 430 nm, while preserving crystalline quality comparable to molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown films. Tuning laser pulsing frequency and fluence led to significant changes in surface roughness, film porosity, and grain boundaries, as well as grain shape. Analysis of cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed a sharp substrate-film interface without atomic intermixing and without the formation of amorphous intermediate layers, establishing PLD as a viable method for producing high-quality Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films.
