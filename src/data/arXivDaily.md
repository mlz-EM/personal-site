- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay between temperature and thickness governing ferroelastic domain wall (DW) behavior in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* heating **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** combined with a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach, researchers tracked DW curvature and density. A distinct interplay was identified: DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200$ nm) were mobile near $T_C$ and froze upon cooling, while DWs in the crossover regime ($200-300$ nm) were nearly static, mapping the evolution of DWs across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes.

- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To perform direct real-space imaging of nanometric skyrmion lattices using Fresnel Magnetic Imaging and investigate limitations in conventional chiral discrimination methods for ultrasmall dimensions.
- **Finding**: **Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)** studies in Fresnel mode on $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ crystals revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon retrieved through conventional analysis. Systematic off-axis electron holography and numerical simulations attributed this misinterpretation to the sinusoidal modulation of the contrast transfer function, establishing quantitative limitations for Fresnel contrast analysis of ultrasmall skyrmions.

**37. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet and determine the origin of observed Hall-resistivity anomalies.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed but showed little correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, suggesting a trivial origin distinct from the topological Hall effect. Crucially, **Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)** measurements ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures, leading to the conclusion that the anomalies originate from the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels due to sample inhomogeneity.

**39. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings in bulk systems.
- **Finding**: Analytical modeling and simulations predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, leading to rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. Experimental validation using *in situ* **Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)** on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models with respect to imaging conditions in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).
- **Finding**: Using synthetic data generated via multislice simulation and the HRTEM contrast transfer function (CTF), the study demonstrated that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability but predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. The CTF framework successfully quantified OOD domain shifts related to experimental imaging parameters.

- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of ($\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x$)$_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnet alloys.
- **Finding**: **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** revealed a significant compressive strain of up to $25\%$ near grain boundaries in the $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys. DFT calculations, informed by these structural observations, showed that while $K_{\rm u}$ is $4.2$ $\text{MJ}/\text{m}^3$ under strain-free conditions, it becomes negative in regions with $25\%$ compressive strain, highlighting the critical influence of lattice distortions on magnetic properties.

- **Objective**: To manipulate and observe the spatial evolution of strain-induced helical domain reorientation mediated by topological defects using uniaxial stress.
- **Finding**: Using *in situ* **Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM)**, the reorientation of the helical propagation vector ($\textbf{Q}$) under tensile stress was observed. The process showed striking similarity to plastic deformation in metals, where magnetic defects mediate reorientation via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes, advancing the understanding of strain-driven magnetism.

- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox concerning the synthesizability and anomalous stability of the metastable solid-state electrolyte $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: DFT calculations revealed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale by low surface energy, significantly lowering the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization was directly visualized using *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and **electron microscopy**, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation to the stable $\gamma$-phase.
