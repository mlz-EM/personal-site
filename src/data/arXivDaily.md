**30. [Structural heterogeneity-induced enhancement of transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion revealed by thermoelectric imaging in functionally graded materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03581v1)**
- **Authors**: Sang J. Park, Ravi Gautam, Takashi Yagi, Rajkumar Modak, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Ken-ichi Uchida
- **Date**: 2026-01-07

**32. [Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01846v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongteng Lin, Xiaotong Xiong, Junjie Liu, Yidong Huang, Fang Liu
- **Date**: 2026-01-05
- **Objective**: To develop a full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction that incorporates two-photon processes and clarifies the relationship between PINEM, Kapitza-Dirac (KD), and nonlinear Compton scattering effects.
- **Finding**: The full quantum theory revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by free electrons can be significantly enhanced by manipulating the optical near field, and quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur. Although primarily theoretical, this work establishes the foundation for interpreting nonlinear processes in future quantum electron microscopy experiments, showing that KD and nonlinear Compton scattering are types of two-photon processes.

- **Authors**: Lauren J. Riddiford, Anne Flechsig, Shilei Ding, Emir Karadza, Niklas Kercher, Tobias Goldenberger, Elisabeth Müller, Pietro Gambardella, Laura J. Heyderman, Aleš Hrabec
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To generate unconventional spin-orbit torques by patterning continuous crystalline phase gradients in tungsten (W) thin films using laser annealing.
- **Finding**: Direct-write laser annealing successfully created continuous phase transformations from the highly spin-orbit coupled $\beta$-W phase to the minimally coupled $\alpha$-W phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was crucial for tracking this transformation. Tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong phase gradient, when interfaced with $\mathrm{CoFeB}$, enabled current-induced magnetization switching without an external magnetic field, demonstrating precise control over local spin-orbit torque efficiency.

- **Authors**: Keyu Cao, Sashank Shivakumar, Jian Luo
- **Date**: 2026-01-01
- **Objective**: To fabricate dense ultrafine-grained (UFG) refractory $\mathrm{MoW}$-based alloys and investigate the effect of cobalt (Co) doping on sintering behavior and high-temperature grain growth resistance.
- **Finding**: Co doping (2 at.\%) enhanced activated sintering and significantly suppressed the relative grain growth rate, especially in compositionally complex alloys, consistent with the high-entropy grain boundary (HEGB) effect. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed strong Co segregation at the grain boundaries, validating the proposed grain boundary segregation model.

- **Date**: 2025-12-31
- **Objective**: To determine how the confined geometry of palladium nanocrystals influences the structural dynamics and pathways of the solute-induced phase transformation to palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$).
- **Finding**: In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) directly visualized hydrogenation in Pd nanocubes and hexagonal nanoplates, showing that while both follow similar transformation sequences, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. This demonstrates that nanocrystal geometry is a fundamental parameter that directs phase transformation pathways, particularly when the system is driven far from equilibrium.

Multimodal microscopy, including 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with a deep-learning framework, was essential for translating contrast into quantitative 3D morphologies and accurate facet identification.

- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **Objective**: To perform in situ observations of phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: Liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM) provided the first detailed study of LC phase transitions in nanoconfinement, revealing that the electron beam induces consecutive phase changes (Smectic A to Nematic, Nematic to Isotropic) primarily via thermal effects. LP-STEM allowed for the real-time observation of these transitions, showing that the thermal properties of nanoconfined 8CB differ significantly from the bulk material.

**42. [Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $\mathrm{SrVO}_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22843v1)**
- **Authors**: Amit Cohen, Jonathan Ludwick, Ward Yahya, Maria Baskin, Lishai Shoham, Tyson C. Back, Lior Kornblum
- **Date**: 2025-12-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate a direct and controllable method for recovering the intrinsic metallic surface of $\mathrm{SrVO}_3$ (SVO) by thermally reducing the oxidized near-surface region (NSR) under ultra-high vacuum.
- **Finding**: Thermal reduction successfully recovered the metallic character of SVO, transforming the surface from $\mathrm{V}^{5+}$-dominated states to $\mathrm{V}^{4+}$-dominated mixed valence states. Ex-situ high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) suggested that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and nanoscale surface reorganization, establishing a practical method for obtaining high-quality $\mathrm{V}^{4+}$ SVO surfaces.

**43. [Concentration-Dependent Tungsten Effects on Short-Range Order and Deformation Behavior in Ni-W alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21745v1)**
- **Authors**: Shaozun Liu, Zehao Li, Hantong Chen, Xingyuan San, Bi-Cheng Zhou, Dieter Isheim, Tiejun Wang, Hong Gao, Nie Zhao, Yu Liu, Yong Gan, Xiaobing Hu
- **Date**: 2025-12-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the effects of W concentration on short-range order (SRO), deformation behavior, and grain boundary chemistry in $\mathrm{Ni}-x\mathrm{W}$ alloys.
- **Finding**: Strong SRO emerges when W content exceeds about $30\ \mathrm{wt}\%$, significantly enhancing strain-hardening capacity and leading to an exceptionally high grain boundary strengthening coefficient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that the presence of SRO promotes planar slip and twin formation during deformation, while atom probe tomography (APT) was used to analyze the grain boundary chemistry, establishing a mechanistic link between W concentration, SRO, and mechanical response.

- **Authors**: E. Salahinejad, M. Jafari Baghjeghaz
- **Date**: 2025-12-24
- **Objective**: To synthesize and evaluate the structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability, and biodegradability of novel $\mathrm{Ca}$-$\mathrm{Mg}$ oxyfluorosilicates doped with fluoride.
- **Finding**: Samples containing up to $2\ \mathrm{mol}\%\ \mathrm{F}$ formed a single-phase structure of F-doped diopside ($\mathrm{MgCaSi}_2\mathrm{O}_6$). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) confirmed that $1\ \mathrm{mol}\%\ \mathrm{F}$ doping achieved the optimal biomineralization characteristic, attributed to the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (forming fluorohydroxyapatite) via an ion-exchange reaction mechanism.

- **Authors**: R. Vahedifard, E. Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of nanostructured diopside ($\mathrm{CaO}\cdot\mathrm{MgO}\cdot 2\mathrm{SiO}_2$) coatings.
- **Finding**: After soaking the nanodiopside coating in simulated body fluid (SBF), a thick apatite layer was formed, substituting the original deposit. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) provided microscopic evidence of this substitution and revealed biased elemental accumulations of P and Si within the newly formed layer, confirming that the in vitro bioactivity is controlled by multiple ion-exchange reactions involving $\mathrm{Ca}$, $\mathrm{Mg}$, $\mathrm{Si}$, and $\mathrm{P}$.

This method yields transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity while maintaining the dose efficiency and capabilities of 4D-STEM.

- **Authors**: E. Salahinejad, M. Jafari Baghjeghaz
- **Date**: 2025-12-22
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of $1\ \mathrm{mol}\%$ fluoride doping on the sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside ($\mathrm{CaMgSi}_2\mathrm{O}_6$) nanopowders.
