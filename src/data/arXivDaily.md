**1. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize e-coherent crystalline interfaces, a new class of interfaces stabilized by non-affine relaxations that introduce unique line defects termed discohesions.
- **Finding**: E-coherency, mediated by discohesions (defects that lack long-range stress fields and alter the state of coherency), fundamentally changes interfacial energetics and kinetics compared to non-e-coherent interfaces. **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** was used alongside atomistic simulations to demonstrate the existence and properties of e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries, suggesting its pervasive nature in crystalline solids.

The results showed that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^2-r^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^2-y^2$, validating the approach against established X-ray measurements but with ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity.

**4. [Probing Boundary Spins in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17173v1)**
- **Authors**: Armando A. Aligia, Alejandro M. Lobos, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Claudio J. Gazza
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Objective**: To propose a method for experimentally detecting localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR).
- **Finding**: When the **STM** tip is in contact with the chain end, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, resulting in a low-bias Kondo peak. Spatially resolving the width of this Kondo resonance as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides a clear, indirect signature of the localized boundary spins, supported by Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations.

- **Finding**: Twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, particularly the out-of-plane $A_{1g}$ mode, serve as clear optical fingerprints of rotational misalignment between cuprate layers. This non-invasive technique is crucial because conventional characterization tools like **electron microscopy** or scanning probe techniques are prone to damaging the highly unstable twisted interface under ambient conditions.

- **Objective**: To explore the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconducting vortex bound states in the transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor $1\text{T}''-\text{NbTe}_2$.
- **Finding**: **Ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS)** revealed the coexistence of a stripe-like $3\times 1\times 3$ CDW order and superconductivity. The vortices observed were elliptical, aligning with the CDW stripes, and crucially, CDW domain boundaries induced abrupt changes in vortex orientation and bound states, establishing a new method for manipulating superconducting vortex states.

- **Authors**: Yaozhu Li, Szilvia Kalácska, Phil McCausland, Roberta L. Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To perform a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the Martian meteorite NWA 7721 to understand its pre-impact deformation history.

Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was critical in distinguishing these populations, providing the first evidence that this olivine preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars before the impact event.

- **Authors**: Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland
- **Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the microscopic structure and influence of regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material $\text{Sr}_2\text{NaNb}_5\text{O}_{15}$.

The investigation showed that these faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, suggesting they could affect the ferroelectric properties.
