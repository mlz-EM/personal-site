**10. [Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942v1)**
- **Authors**: Vaibhav Choudhary, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Objective**: To improve feature localization in secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and helium ion microscopy (HIM), by modeling the full distribution of SE counts as a mixture rather than a convolution.

- **Authors**: Chuanhai Gan, Chuanlian Xiao, Hongguang Wang, Peter A. van Aken, Rotraut Merkle, Sebastian Bette, Bettina V. Lotsch, Joachim Maier
- **Date**: 2025-08-12
- **Objective**: To systematically study the difficult intercalation of sodium (Na) into highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) under various chemical and electrochemical conditions.

- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: To determine the intrinsic magnetic properties at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ materials using first-principles calculations, based on structures derived from high-resolution electron microscopy images.
- **Finding**: First-principles calculations were used to determine magnetic moments and crystal field coefficients for two model interface structures (stoichiometric twin and stacking fault) derived from recently reported high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images. The HREM images provided the crucial atomistic structural input, revealing that these interfaces modify magnetic properties at the sub-nanometer scale. Specifically, in the R-rich region of the "stacking fault," the local easy axis of magnetization rotates by $49^\circ$, which may lead to reduced coercivity.

Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was combined with density first-principles calculations and discrete dislocation dynamics simulations to reveal that these loops form via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed perfect dislocations under stress, a process unique to iridium among face-centered cubic metals. These immobile loops act as potent barriers, explaining the material's high yield strength and work hardening.

**26. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+δ}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: Investigate the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ to understand the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.
- **Finding**: Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers, ultimately suppressing superconductivity. **Multislice electron ptychography** and **electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)** were crucial in revealing these atomic-scale structural and electronic properties, specifically identifying the Pr site preference and the formation of the striped interstitial oxygen order.

- **Objective**: Investigate the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) during various processing steps, such as pressing and heat treatment.
- **Finding**: Processing steps significantly influence supercrystalline defects in SCNCs: pressing distorts the superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults and size-dependent symmetries. Importantly, heat treatment induces migration and healing of stacking faults and structural changes at inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries. These insights into defect evolution at the supercrystalline scale were revealed through **X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses**.

- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23

- **Authors**: Brinthan Kanesalingam, Darshan Chalise, Carsten Detlefs, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: Develop an inverse modeling framework, computational framework, and sensitivity analysis for reconstructing the full deformation-gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) from Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) data.
