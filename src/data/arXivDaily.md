**28. [Mechanistic Transition from Screw to Edge Dislocation Glide Enhances High-Temperature Strength in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10869v1)**
- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism by which edge dislocations, rather than the traditionally dominant screw dislocations, control strength and enhance high-temperature performance in refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs).
- **Finding**: Increasing the V content in the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system introduces substantial atomic misfit, which preferentially raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual mechanistic transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) was used to analyze the microstructural features related to dislocation activity.

- **Date**: 2025-11-12
- **Objective**: To enhance the electrocatalytic performance of high-entropy nanoalloys (based on carbon-doped Cantor alloy) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by exploiting and controlling their phase metastability through post-synthesis annealing.
- **Finding**: Annealing the amorphous nanoparticles at $600~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ induced crystallization and element partitioning, resulting in heterostructured nanoparticles with reinforced carbon shells. This structural change led to a 5- to 7-fold enhancement in OER activity compared to the as-synthesized counterparts. In situ electron microscopy was critical for observing the crystallization and elemental partitioning processes upon heating.

- **Date**: 2025-11-12
- **Objective**: To comprehensively characterize the complex sequence of phase transformations occurring in the metastable $\beta$ $\text{Zr}_{15}\text{Nb}$ alloy during linear heating using a multi-technique approach.

- **Authors**: Simon Hettler, Raul Arenal
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanical and electrical properties of a nano-sized gap formed at a grain boundary in a misfit layered compound using in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).
- **Finding**: The device allowed for precisely controllable mechanical bending by applying differential heating currents.

- **Authors**: Yaozhu Li, Szilvia Kalácska, Phil McCausland, Roberta L. Flemming, Callum Hetherington, Bo Zhao, Can Yildirim, Carsten Detlefs
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: To conduct a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine in the Martian meteorite NWA 7721 to determine if it preserves evidence of pre-impact crustal deformation on Mars.
- **Finding**: The olivine exhibits a bimodal microstructure: fine, strain-free Type 1 subgrains (shock-induced recrystallization) and coarse, strongly strained Type 2 subgrains (preserving a highly deformed parent grain). This suggests the olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress on Mars before the impact. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) was used alongside Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to map the orientation and strain fields of the distinct subgrain populations.

- **Objective**: To investigate the microscopic structure and influence of regular stacking faults in the ferroelectric tetragonal tungsten bronze material $\text{Sr}_2\text{NaNb}_5\text{O}_{15}$.
- **Finding**: The stacking faults, characterized by a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four, resulting in four domains related to the $\text{NbO}_6$ octahedral tilts. Calculations suggest the faults significantly affect the local polar modes present in the structure, potentially influencing ferroelectric properties, with an estimated stacking fault energy of $46~\mathrm{mJ/m}^2$. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to visualize and determine the crystallographic structure of the faults.

- **Authors**: Shun Takahashi, Yusuke Wakamoto, Kazuhiro Kuruma, Takuya Maeda, Yasuyuki Ozeki
- **Date**: 2025-11-07
- **Objective**: To propose and demonstrate multimodal 3D stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MPPL) microscopy for non-destructive, high-speed characterization and type identification of threading dislocations (TDs) in $\text{GaN}$ crystals.
- **Finding**: SRS microscopy achieved a $10^2-10^3$ times acceleration in imaging speed compared to spontaneous Raman microscopy, enabling 3D visualization of strain fields induced by TDs. The multimodal approach provided rich information on TD features, including Burgers vectors and propagation directions. Screw-type TDs, critical killer defects, were deterministically identified by exploiting the lack of SRS peak shifts at the dislocation core combined with MPPL patterns, offering a non-destructive alternative to traditional electron microscopy defect analysis.
