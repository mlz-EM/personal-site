- **Finding**: The study observed that Pt nanoparticles in contact with Si pads transformed into a more mobile platinum silicide ($Pt_3Si$) phase, exhibiting pronounced directional migration away from the Si pads, driven by interfacial energy gradients. This directed movement fundamentally dictated coalescence pathways, leading to either enhanced sintering or inhibited coalescence. **In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** was employed to directly observe and investigate the real-time dynamics of Pt nanoparticle migration and assembly on the substrate at $800^\circ C$, providing critical insights into how substrate heterogeneity controls nanoparticle behavior.

- **Date**: 2025-05-31
- **Objective**: To address a one-dimensional phase problem linking energy and time, arising in X-ray scattering from ultrasharp nuclear resonances, by leveraging ptychographic phase retrieval principles.
- **Finding**: The study successfully used multiple energetically overlapping measurements of nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron X-ray pulses in the time domain to retrieve both the transmission spectrum and the phase of the scattering response, similar to ptychographic phase retrieval in imaging. This robust approach overcomes bandwidth limitations of traditional gamma-ray sources.

- **Authors**: J. M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
- **Date**: 2025-05-30
- **Objective**: To study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si) formed by self-ion implantation amorphization, focusing on the evolution of Medium-Range Order (MRO) upon thermal annealing.

- **Date**: 2025-05-27
- **Objective**: To investigate the alterations in magnetic properties and electronic structure of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown nano-dimensional $MoS_2$ after low energy ion irradiation, aiming to induce and enhance robust room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM).
- **Finding**: Low energy Argon ion irradiation induced lattice defects like S-vacancies and caused fragmentation of large $MoS_2$ flakes into smaller ones, enhancing the number of edge-terminated structures. The pristine sample exhibited diamagnetic behavior, but saturation magnetization increased significantly with increasing irradiation fluences, demonstrating that edge-terminated structures and point defects (S-vacancies) induce robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. **Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)** images confirmed the triangular-flake formation in the pristine sample and showed the fragmentation of big flakes into smaller ones after irradiation, indicating an increase in the number of edge-terminated structures.

- **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Caio Machado Fernandes, Mauro C. Santos
- **Date**: 2025-05-23
- **Objective**: To examine the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with fluorine (F)-doped niobium oxide ($Nb_2O_5$) nanoparticles to enhance $H_2O_2$ electrogeneration via the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

- **Authors**: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Vanessa S. Antonin, Caio Machado Fernandes, Liying Liu, Mauro C. Santos
- **Date**: 2025-05-22
- **Objective**: To investigate the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with Ce-doped $Nb_2O_5$ as electrocatalysts for improved $H_2O_2$ electrogeneration via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

- **Authors**: Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: To elucidate the critical factors bridging strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity in $La_3Ni_2O_7$ films using density functional theory calculations.
- **Finding**: The study found an $I4/mmm$ structural transition at -0.9% strain, preceding superconductivity onset, consistent with recent experimental observations. Compressive strain lowered Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital energy levels, while interfacial Sr diffusion reconstructed $d_{z^2}$ pockets. Suppressed charge density waves (CDW) and spin density waves (SDW) instabilities, analogous to pressure effects, and enhanced interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling ($J_\perp$) were identified as crucial for both strain- and pressure-driven superconductivity. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** observations were explicitly mentioned as providing experimental consistency for the $I4/mmm$ structural transition found in the theoretical calculations, highlighting its role in validating structural predictions.

- **Authors**: Bo Hao, Maosen Wang, Wenjie Sun, Yang Yang, Zhangwen Mao, Shengjun Yan, Haoying Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Lu Han, Zhengbin Gu, Jian Zhou, Dianxiang Ji, Yuefeng Nie
- **Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Objective**: To explore the phase diagram of heterovalent Sr-doping in $La_{3-x}Sr_xNi_2O_7$ thin films and investigate its impact on ambient pressure superconductivity.
- **Finding**: The superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) followed an asymmetric dome-like profile across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$), with optimal $T_c \sim 42 K$ at $x = 0.09$, achieving high critical current and upper critical fields. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** revealed that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar $NiO_2$ sites, unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples, due to Coulomb repulsion under compressive strain. STEM also showed elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by 4%, likely weakening the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling and contributing to the reduced $T_c$ in strained films.
