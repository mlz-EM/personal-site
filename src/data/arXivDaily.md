**1. [Ultrafast laser-driven topological phase patterning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03881v1)**
- **Authors**: Jianyu Wu, Arthur Niedermayr, Gaolong Cao, Oscar Grånäs, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2026-01-07
- **Objective**: To demonstrate femtosecond laser-driven spatial and temporal control over phase transitions in the Weyl semimetal $\mathrm{WTe}_2$.

- **Date**: 2025-12-29
- **Objective**: To perform *in situ* observations of phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy.

**30. [Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384v2)**
- **Authors**: Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad
- **Date**: 2025-12-19
- **Objective**: Investigate the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios in electrodeposited overlays on the high-temperature oxidation mechanism and resistance of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings.

- **Finding**: The combination of XPEEM with a spatial-attention based deep learning corrective algorithm, termed nanoXPEEM, achieved a record spatial resolution of $48\text{ nm}$ over a $232\text{-}\mu\text{m}$ diameter FoV in the soft X-ray regime. This deep learning approach overcomes limitations imposed by chromatic and spherical aberrations, enabling unique nanoscale spatial mapping of element-specificity and local structure.

- **Authors**: Jun Lu, Iain Dixon, Kwangmin Kim, Yan Xin, Hongyu Bai
- **Date**: 2025-12-18

- **Authors**: Abby Liu, Zhucong Xi, Xiaobo Chen, Catherine Huang, Meng Li, Judith C. Yang, Liang Qi, Dmitri N. Zakharov, Rachel S. Goldman
- **Date**: 2025-12-17
- **Objective**: Elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms governing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of Gallium Nitride (GaN) from Ga droplet arrays using real-time observation.
- **Finding**: **Real-time environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM)** revealed that GaN growth occurs preferentially at pre-existing GaN nuclei at low temperatures, and at intermediate to high temperatures, nucleation and growth occur from Ga droplets, with enhanced crystallinity due to epitaxial templating. These observations highlight the critical role of the Ga/GaN interface in facilitating $\text{NH}_3$ decomposition and GaN growth.

- **Date**: 2025-12-15
- **Objective**: Investigate the effect of a Scandium Nitride (ScN) buffer layer on the superconducting properties of thin Niobium Nitride (NbN) films.
- **Finding**: The use of an ScN buffer layer significantly improved the superconducting characteristics of $29\text{ nm}$ thick NbN films, increasing the critical temperature $T_c$ from $9\text{ K}$ to $12.5\text{ K}$. This enhancement is attributed to the improved lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which leads to a higher quality NbN crystal lattice, a finding confirmed by **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** and X-ray diffraction data.

- **Authors**: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
- **Date**: 2025-12-14
- **Objective**: Report a pronounced magnetically coupled electro-optic (EO) effect in $\text{LiNbO}_3$ and $\text{LiTaO}_3$ and identify the origin of this coupling, which solves the long-standing DC drift reliability issue.
- **Finding**: The DC drift was traced to defect-bound unpaired electrons whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched by the magnetic-field-induced formation of room-temperature skyrmion states. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** was used for direct visualization of this collective spin ordering (skyrmion states), confirming the magnetic control mechanism and demonstrating an orders-of-magnitude enhancement in the EO efficiency (up to $34\text{ pm/V}$ in $\text{LiNbO}_3$).

- **Authors**: Luka Geddis Zellmann, Sumner B. Harris, John R. R. Scott, Yi-Chieh Yang, Joerg Jinschek, Rama Vasudevan, Miryam Arredondo
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Investigate how temperature influences the thickness-dependent behavior of ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) in free-standing $\text{LaAlO}_3$ thin films, spanning dipolar and crossover elastic regimes.
- **Finding**: Using **in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** combined with machine-learning image analysis, a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness was identified. DWs in the dipolar regime ($<200\text{ nm}$) were mobile near $T_C$ and froze upon cooling, while DWs in the crossover regime ($200-300\text{ nm}$) remained nearly static, mapping the evolution of DWs across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes.

- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Directly image nanometric skyrmion lattices in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ using Fresnel Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and quantify the limitations of conventional contrast analysis for ultrasmall magnetic textures.
- **Finding**: **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** in Fresnel mode revealed that conventional chiral discrimination methods lead to an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon. Systematic **off-axis electron holography** and simulations attributed this misinterpretation to the sinusoidal modulation of the contrast transfer function (CTF) correlating with defocus and skyrmion dimensions, establishing quantitative constraints for nanoscale magnetic imaging.

**46. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: Investigate the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies (topological-Hall-like signals) observed in $\text{Zn}$-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet, and determine if they arise from chiral spin textures.
- **Finding**: Hall-resistivity anomalies were observed but showed little correlation with magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, suggesting a trivial origin. Crucially, **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** measurements definitively ruled out the existence of chiral spin textures in the ferrimagnet. The anomalies were thus attributed to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity, urging a re-evaluation of topological Hall claims based solely on transport data.

**48. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: Establish a comprehensive framework, combining theory, simulation, and experiment, for the three-dimensional control and manipulation of magnetic skyrmion strings using external strain.
- **Finding**: Analytical models and micromagnetic simulations predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, leading to rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. **In situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)** experiments on $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, demonstrating that strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the dominant control mechanism.

- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: Investigate and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance of neural network segmentation models used for High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) imaging.
- **Finding**: Using synthetic HRTEM data generated via multislice simulation, the study found that neural network segmentation models exhibit significant performance stability but predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. A framework utilizing the HRTEM **Contrast Transfer Function (CTF)** was developed to effectively quantify OOD domain shifts related to imaging conditions, aiding in the reliable deployment of neural networks in experimental workflows.

- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: Explore the effects of lattice distortion (strain) on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnets using first-principles calculations.
- **Finding**: Calculations showed that $K_{\rm u}$ decreases dramatically and becomes negative under $25\%$ compressive strain, highlighting the critical influence of lattice distortions on magnetic properties. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** confirmed the physical context by revealing significant compressive strain (up to $25\%$) near the grain boundaries of the $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys, providing essential input for micromagnetic simulations.
