**26. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v2)**
- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: Clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and underlying fracture mechanism in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture in the elastic regime, with fractographic studies showing intergranular and quasi-cleavage crack initiation. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and later {$100$} ferrite cleavage cracking after significant crack growth. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies on cross-sectional cracks, combined with TEM observations, supported a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to crack tips promotes high-velocity brittle fracture, inhibiting crack blunting and leading to {$100$} ferrite cleavage cracking with river pattern features.

**27. [Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166v1)**
- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: Investigate how dopants self-organize and alter local structure within amorphous interfacial complexions in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and elemental analysis revealed chemical partitioning at both grain and interphase boundaries, with specific dopant enrichment/depletion at the amorphous-crystalline transition region. This chemical patterning, driven by elemental preference for ordered/disordered environments, was found to modulate structural short-range order. While nanobeam electron diffraction provided qualitative measures, atomistic simulations confirmed that increased chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation at transition regions driving local structural changes sensitive to dopant ratios.

- **Objective**: Investigate thickness-induced topological phase transitions in $\alpha$-Sn films grown on CdTe(110) using helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC).
- **Finding**: HDPC measurements showed a distinct dependence on film thickness, transitioning from an odd-function dependence for 5 nm $\alpha$-Sn to an even-function dependence for 10 and 30 nm films. Combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, these results revealed a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a 2D to a 3D topological insulator occurring between 5 and 10 nm. This demonstrates HDPC as a sensitive diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions, enabling tunable electronic properties for spin-based devices.

- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: Investigate the interplay of interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain in controlling polarization and chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films.
- **Finding**: Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that anisotropic compressive strain in BFO films on La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO)-buffered NdGaO$_3$ substrates promotes ferroelectric domain formation. A fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer was deterministically formed on regions with polarization opposite to the LSMO-imposed orientation, stabilizing the nanoscale domain architecture. By inserting a Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius buffer layer, a uniform out-of-plane polarization was achieved. Local polarization switching experiments also revealed signatures of homochiral polarization textures, demonstrating new strategies for controlling polarization direction and chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics.

- **Authors**: Zanlin Cheng, Jiawen Zhang, Peng Gao, Guosong Zeng, Xufei Fang, Wenjun Lu
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: Explore a new approach to improve the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching.
- **Finding**: Surface scratching with a Brinell indenter along the [100] direction effectively generated edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Nanoindentation tests, surface morphology analysis, and microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that these introduced dislocations significantly mitigated cleavage crack formation during indentation, in contrast to as-received $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers facilitated stable plastic deformation, thereby preventing brittle fracture and toughening the material.

- **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: Resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced experimental techniques and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging of partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, revealed that previously observed broad transitional regions are projection artifacts of intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of $180^{\circ}$ domain walls. Switching proceeds via collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, consistent with nucleation-limited switching. STEM confirmed these zigzag domain walls as a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. Increased Sc content was shown to lower domain wall energy and nucleation barrier, reducing the switching field, establishing a direct link between local domain wall structure, switching kinetics, and macroscopic ferroelectric behavior.

- **Authors**: Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: Investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by annealing or laser heating, focusing on structural and electronic properties.
- **Finding**: The highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe was found to transform into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe while preserving crystal orientation, induced by global annealing or localized laser heating. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was crucial for investigating the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface. The study proposes that clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures drives the transition, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through minor GeSe$_2$ segregation. A high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$ between the two phases was observed, highlighting GeSe's potential for phase-change memory.

- **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: Investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations within the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand its underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize defects and chemical fluctuations in CoNi-based superalloys compressed at $850^{\circ}$C. The study revealed that Shockley partial dislocations (a/6<112>) cross-slip from one {111} plane to another {111} conjugate plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies. Local stress concentrations also played a critical role. The formation of sessile stair-rod dislocations enhances high-temperature deformation resistance, improving alloy performance.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) dislocation analysis, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealed that Mo substitution in the L1$_2$ phase altered dislocation behavior, promoting multiple deformation modes including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These mechanisms, facilitated by low stacking fault energy of the FCC matrix and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries, explain the impressive mechanical properties, offering a novel strategy for high-performance medium-entropy alloy design.

Atomic-resolution TEM was critical in verifying the epitaxial relationship and single-variant nature. First-principles density functional theory calculations supported that the mutual correspondence of oxygen atom occupancy at the RuO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ interface plays a decisive role.
