**1. [Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhe Hu, Zisheng Yao, Yuhe Zhang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework that eliminates the need for handcrafted constraints in Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) by combining untrained coordinate-based neural fields and a physics-consistent forward model.
- **Finding**: CDIP substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability for both static and dynamic reconstructions. This framework provides a broadly applicable paradigm shift for coherent imaging modalities, including those utilizing electron probes (e.g., ptychography and holography), by solving the ill-posed phase retrieval problem without object-specific constraints.

**2. [Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09518v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-10
- **Objective**: To establish a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings in bulk systems.
- **Finding**: Analytical modeling and simulations predicted that strain induces elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings, driving the system toward collapse via bobber formation at critical strain levels. *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirmed strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase, directly demonstrating that strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the primary control mechanism.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To probe and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization behavior of neural network segmentation models with respect to varying imaging conditions in High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).

- **Date**: 2025-11-18
- **Objective**: Systematically analyze the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in $\text{Fe}_{4-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{N}$ thin films, focusing on the influence of Ge substitution and resulting anisotropy.
- **Finding**: The films undergo a structural transition from cubic $\text{Fe}_4\text{N}$ to tetragonal symmetry for $x>0.35$. The tetragonal samples ($x=0.8$ and $x=1$) display unusual two-component behavior in AHE and ANE hysteresis loops, which is attributed to the coexistence of two crystallographic orientations (c-axis and a-axis normal to the film) and the opposite sign of AHE/ANE for magnetization along the different axes. Electron microscopy was used to characterize the crystallographic structure and orientations crucial for explaining the observed transport phenomena.

**31. [Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13917v1)**
- **Authors**: Anand Ithepalli, Saumya Vashishtha, Naomi Pieczulewski, Qiao Liu, Amit Rohan Rajapurohita, Matthew Barone, Darrell Schlom, David A. Muller, Huili Grace Xing, Debdeep Jena
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Objective**: Investigate how varying the miscut angle of c-plane sapphire substrates influences the structural quality and superconducting properties of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown niobium nitride (NbN) thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing the substrate miscut angle from $0.5^\circ$ to $10^\circ$ significantly improved the structural quality of the NbN films (FWHM decreased from 76 arcsecs to 20 arcsecs), leading to a marginal increase in superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) from 12.1 K to 12.5 K.

- **Authors**: Tamanna Zakia, Ayeman Nahin, Dunji Yu, Jacob Pustelnik, Juntan Li, Mason Kincheloe, Lia Amalia, Yan Chen, Peter K. Liaw, Haixuan Xu, Mingwei Zhang
- **Date**: 2025-11-14
- **Objective**: Uncover the mechanism responsible for the transition from screw dislocation-controlled to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, which enhances the high-temperature strength of refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs).
- **Finding**: Increasing the Vanadium (V) content in the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system introduces substantial atomic misfit, which raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual mechanistic transition to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, resulting in markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used alongside *in-situ* neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the dislocation structures and confirm the transition mechanism.

- **Authors**: Annett Thøgersen, Georg Muntingh, Lasse Vines, Øystein Prytz, Max Kneiß, Marius Grundmann, Holger von Wenckstern, Ingvild J. T. Jensen
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Objective**: Resolve band gap variations across $\kappa$-$\text{Ga}_2\text{O}_3$-based multilayers at the nanometer scale using STEM-EELS to decouple the influence of composition and interfacial strain.
- **Finding**: For heterostructures grown on ITO templates, strain at defect-free interfaces induces a gradual band gap transition from $5.08~\text{eV}$ to $4.28~\text{eV}$ over $\sim 10~\text{nm}$, despite an abrupt compositional change. Conversely, ZnO templates introduce structural defects that relieve strain, yielding band gaps consistent with composition. Monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) was established as a powerful tool for nanoscale electronic characterization, highlighting the dominant role of interfacial strain over composition in governing the local band structure.

- **Objective**: Investigate the microscopic structure and local influence of regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze ferroic material $\text{Sr}_2\text{NaNb}_5\text{O}_{15}$.
- **Finding**: Stacking faults, characterized by a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four due to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement, leading to four possible directions of the $S_3$ order parameter (related to $\text{NbO}_6$ octahedral tilts). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize these faults, revealing that they have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, which could influence the material's ferroelectric properties.
