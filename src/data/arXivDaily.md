**1. [Information in 4D-STEM: Where it is, and How to Use it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21034v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data and consequently identify new imaging modes, including crude but fast approximations to ptychography.
- **Finding**: The study revisited H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism to show that tilt correction and summation of symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk (tcBF and tcDPC) enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximizes 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond WPOA, it identified contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons and demonstrated a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) for depth sectioning of strong scatterers, generalizing phase contrast theory to 4D-STEM.

- **Authors**: Dmitry Lapkin, Cong Yan, Emre Gürsoy, Hadas Sternlicht, Alexander Plunkett, Büsra Bor, Young Yong Kim, Dameli Assalauova, Fabian Westermeier, Michael Sprung, Tobias Krekeler, Surya Snata Rout, Martin Ritter, Satishkumar Kulkarni, Thomas F. Keller, Gerold A. Schneider, Gregor B. Vonbun-Feldbauer, Robert H. Meissner, Andreas Stierle, Ivan A. Vartanyants, Diletta Giuntini
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To show how each processing step plays a distinct role in the generation, migration, interaction, and healing of supercrystalline defects in supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs).
- **Finding**: The study revealed, via X-ray and in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses, that pressing SCNCs into bulk pellets distorts the fcc superlattice, while emulsion-templated self-assembly yields supraparticles with stacking faults. Heat treatment significantly affects planar defects, causing stacking faults to migrate and heal, and inter-supercrystalline 'grain' boundaries to undergo structural changes, providing new insights into the formation and evolution of ordered assemblies of functionalized nanoparticles.

**3. [Femtosecond Engineering of magnetic Domain Walls via Nonequilibrium Spin Textures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20701v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuzhu Fan, Gaolong Cao, Junlin Wang, Sheng Jiang, Jing Wu, Johan Åkerman, Jonas Weissenrieder
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Objective**: To directly image the real-time formation of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film under ultrafast optical excitation.
- **Finding**: Using Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with transient optical grating excitation, the researchers directly imaged the rapid evolution from disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. This technique revealed that in a narrow fluence window, short-lived DWs form and spontaneously vanish within picoseconds, which multiscale simulations explained as a nonlinear nucleation pathway involving localized, unstable spin textures coalescing into metastable DWs.

**4. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency for STEM phase retrieval methods, addressing the limitations of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
- **Finding**: The study showed that SSNR is a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods compared to CTF, which can significantly overestimate practical performance in low-dose regimes. Using numerical reconstructions, it demonstrated that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, while iterative ptychography shows a surprising dose dependence, converging to direct ptychography's SSNR at low fluence and saturating at high fluence.

This setup provided at least a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition with an azimuthally polarized beam, opening new opportunities for the spectroscopy of forbidden transitions. The paper focuses on optical techniques and nanoscale engineering, without direct electron microscopy contributions to the findings.

- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the atomic-scale organization of dipoles within polar layers of ultrathin ZrO$_2$ films, specifically focusing on the formation of 180-degree domain walls.
- **Finding**: By utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of an ultrathin ZrO$_2$ film in plan view, the study showed that within irreducibly narrow polar layers, dipole organization can be strikingly non-uniform, forming atomically thin, dimensionally confined, charged 180-degree domain walls. These walls, alternating between head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations, adopt completely distinctive interfacial structures and confine in-plane domains to a sub-$nm^2$ footprint, representing the first experimental observation of antipolar ferroic ordering nested within self-organized polar nonpolar layering.

- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To relax the stringent Nyquist sampling requirements of direct ptychography by formulating parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation, thereby enabling upsampling in direct ptychography.
- **Finding**: The study formulated parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to direct ptychography, using this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography and thus relaxing its traditional resolution limits imposed by the probe step size. The analytical results were demonstrated numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions, showing a significant advancement in non-iterative electron ptychography techniques.

Zac Ward, Benjamin Lawrie, Guang Bian, James Burns, Jonathan D. Poplawsky, Myung-Geun Han, Yimei Zhu, Lucas Lindsay, Hu Miao, Robert G. Moore, Gyula Eres, Valentino R. Cooper, Matthew Brahlek
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe with high structural quality and phase purity can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates in molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: The study successfully demonstrated programmable phase selection of MnTe polymorphs. Electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction together indicated that the phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface. First principles calculations suggested that interfacial termination and strain have a significant effect on the interfacial energy, stabilizing the NiAs polymorph on In-terminated surfaces and the ZnS structure on P-terminated surfaces.

**10. [Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364v1)**
- **Authors**: Jan Hajduček, Antoine Andrieux, Jon Ander Arregi, Martin Tichý, Paolo Cattaneo, Beatrice Ferrari, Fabrizio Carbone, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Thomas LaGrange
- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To experimentally demonstrate the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation during ultrafast magnetostructural phase transitions, specifically investigating how cumulative laser irradiation alters nucleation pathways in FeRh thin films.
- **Finding**: Taking advantage of the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ transmission electron microscopy, the researchers observed that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition of FeRh thin films, causing a switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a decrease of 20 K in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned in the film by underlying dislocation networks, which are formed and rearranged upon repeated phase transition crossings.

**12. [Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940v2)**
- **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs).
- **Finding**: The study successfully detected differences in frequency, width, and amplitude of peaks in the oscillation of functionalized SiNPs compared to non-functionalized ones, which could be explained by a theoretical model. While transmission electron microscopy was carried out, it did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types, indicating that the observed differences were subtle and related to the optomechanical properties rather than gross morphological changes detectable by TEM.

- **Authors**: Brinthan Kanesalingam, Darshan Chalise, Carsten Detlefs, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To develop an inverse modeling framework for Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to explicitly relate angular shifts to strain and lattice rotation tensors, enabling reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor, and to perform sensitivity analysis.
- **Finding**: The study developed an inverse modeling formalism for DFXM, demonstrating that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible using oblique diffraction geometry. It also established a computational framework for forward calculation of angular shifts and reconstruction of $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$, along with methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific DFXM angles and compute associated errors. While the paper mentions TEM for comparison of spatial resolution, its primary focus and contribution are in DFXM.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality in tetragonal tungsten bronzes (K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$) and understand the origin of their chirality and its coupling to external fields.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated ferrochirality in K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$. Using high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy, the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures were solved. TEM helped confirm the structural details, revealing that chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms perpendicular to the c direction, and a spatially varying piezoelectric response consistent with the polycrystalline nature was observed, suggesting electric-strain-field coupling as a conjugate field for switching chirality.

- **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the fragmentation and coalescence behavior of copper (Cu) nanoparticles subjected to femtosecond (fs) laser scanning and understand the underlying ablation mechanisms relevant to sintering applications.
- **Finding**: The study revealed a bimodal transformation in Cu nanoparticles under fs laser irradiation, with the emergence of sub-60 nm debris and formation of large aggregates, as observed through particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy. Analysis showed that hot electron blast, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and blast pressures above 4 GPa, is the dominant nonthermal ablation pathway, rather than Coulomb explosion, providing critical insights for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing.

- **Objective**: To develop a new, highly sensitive, label-free technique for 3D imaging of subcellular organization and morphology, utilizing plasmonic metamaterials to translate refractive index changes directly into color.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated ultramicrotome-assisted optical plasmon-enhanced (PE) array tomography, which enables axially super-resolved label-free imaging of whole cells. Crucially, this optical method was correlated with electron array tomography of the same sample embedded in resin, confirming its potential for multimodal three-dimensional colorimetric histology at the (sub-)organelle level by providing complementary structural information at high resolution.

- **Finding**: The study revealed significant anisotropic displacement parameters for Zn and P atoms in GdZn$_3$P$_3$ via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiment further demonstrated the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability. This structural insight, combined with magnetic and electrical measurements, established GdZn$_3$P$_3$ as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carriers and triangular lattice magnetism, on the background of short-range bond order.

Time-resolved optical spectroscopies further explored the optical and dynamical properties. While electron microscopy is mentioned as a challenging conventional technique for this purpose, XAS and optical analysis were the primary techniques contributing to the detailed findings on Zn incorporation.

- **Finding**: The study confirmed lattice-matching at $x = 0.14$ Sc composition regardless of GaN interlayer thickness using X-ray diffraction. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigation of the Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor influencing nitride composition variation and band structure profile along the growth direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) further revealed delays in Sc incorporation relative to Al at both onset and termination, providing critical insights for optimizing growth conditions for low-defect complex multilayers.

- **Authors**: Seung Gyo Jeong, Bonnie Y. X. Lin, Mengru Jin, In Hyeok Choi, Seungjun Lee, Zhifei Yang, Sreejith Nair, Rashmi Choudhary, Juhi Parikh, Anand Santhosh, Matthew Neurock, Kelsey A. Stoerzinger, Jong Seok Lee, Tony Low, Qing Tu, James M. LeBeau, Bharat Jalan
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that interfacial polarization can robustly modulate the surface work function in metallic rutile RuO$_2$ layers within epitaxial RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$ heterostructures.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that interfacial polarization can modulate the RuO$_2$ work function by over 1 eV. Using multislice electron ptychography, the researchers directly visualized polar displacements of transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite the conductive nature of RuO$_2$. This direct visualization provided crucial evidence for the strain-stabilized interfacial polarization, which is controlled by small thickness variations and leads to significant work function tuning.

**26. [Mass-transport-limited reaction rates and molecular diffusion in the van der Waals gap beneath graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07479v1)**
-   **Authors**: Hossein Mirdamadi, Jiří David, Rui Wang, Tianle Jiang, Yanming Wang, Karel Vařeka, Michal Dymáček, Petr Bábor, Tomáš Šikola, Miroslav Kolíbal
-   **Date**: 2025-07-10
-   **Objective**: To identify the kinetic limitations of confined reactions within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between a two-dimensional material and a catalytic substrate.
-   **Finding**: The study found that etching reaction rates of graphene in the vdW gap by various molecules (O$_2$, H$_2$, and CO) are limited by mass transport within the confined space, even for CO, which exhibited anomalously enhanced transport due to a significant lifting of the vdW gap. In situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to study the dynamics of graphene etching, directly revealing this mass-transport limitation. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further revealed multiple etching pathways for CO, enabled by confinement, suggesting the vdW gap acts as an effective nanoreactor once mass-transport limitations are overcome.

**27. [3D Atomic-Scale Metrology of Strain Relaxation and Roughness in Gate-All-Around (GAA) Transistors via Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07265v1)**
-   **Authors**: Shake Karapetyan, Steven E. Zeltmann, Glen Wilk, Ta-Kun Chen, Vincent D. -H. Hou, David A. Muller
-   **Date**: 2025-07-09
-   **Objective**: To enable 3D atomic-scale metrology of buried features in next-generation Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors to identify and resolve performance-limiting fabrication challenges.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational electron microscopy technique, providing sub-Ångström lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution for 3D imaging of buried features. By performing MEP on prototype GAA transistors, the researchers uncovered and quantified distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. This technique allowed for the quantification of strain relaxation, showing that silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxes away from interfaces, and interface roughness, revealing different atomic-scale profiles for top and bottom interfaces, which were previously unquantifiable for such small 3D structures and significantly impact carrier mobility.

**28. [Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06756v1)**
-   **Authors**: Tamazouzt Chennit, Songge Li, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Christoph Hofer, Nadine J. Schrenker, Liberato Manna, Sara Bals, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
-   **Date**: 2025-07-09
-   **Objective**: To investigate the convergence properties of iterative electron ptychography methods, with particular attention to the impact of user-defined update strengths, for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that carefully chosen, relatively small update strengths for both the object and probe are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential in iterative electron ptychography, especially under low electron doses ($<$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$). Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, it was shown that convergence is practically achievable only when these update strengths are small. The findings highlight the existence of critical values below which the algorithms can be trapped in local minima, emphasizing the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters for effective convergence and correctness of results in low-dose electron ptychography.

Three types of defects were identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl$_2$ domains, and Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl$_3$ domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. The atomic-resolution capabilities of STEM also allowed for the observation of a novel crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe$_5$Cl$_{18}$. These findings advance the understanding of intercalation mechanisms in 2D materials and highlight the profound impact of atomic-scale defects on their properties and potential technological applications.

-   **Authors**: Yue Pan, Shiyu Zhen, Xiaozhi Liu, Mengshu Ge, Jianxiong Zhao, Lin Gu, Dan Zhou, Liang Zhang, Dong Su
-   **Date**: 2025-07-07
-   **Objective**: To uncover the complex metal-support interactions that fundamentally govern the catalytic performance of heterogeneous systems during redox reactions.
-   **Finding**: Utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the study revealed a novel type of looping metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ catalysts during hydrogen oxidation reaction. It was observed that lattice oxygens at the NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ interfaces react with NiFe-activated hydrogen atoms, leading to their gradual sacrifice and resulting in dynamically migrating interfaces. Simultaneously, reduced iron atoms migrate to the {111} surface of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support and react with oxygen molecules. These operando TEM observations provided previously unidentified mechanistic insight, showing that the hydrogen oxidation reaction spatially separates on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support through the dynamic migration of metal-support interfaces.

-   **Objective**: To address the challenge of misaligned cropping of raw diffraction patterns in ptychography, which can compromise reconstruction fidelity, by developing a subpixel correction method.
-   **Finding**: The authors present an approach based on automatic differentiation (AD), where the cropping shift is treated as an optimizable parameter within the ptychographic reconstruction framework. By integrating shift correction into the backpropagation loop, their method simultaneously refines the object, probe, and shift positions without requiring manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method achieves subpixel correction (average deviation below 0.5 pixels even with initial offsets up to 5 pixels), and experiments in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime further validated its robustness and effectiveness. This AD-based strategy enhances the automation and robustness of ptychographic reconstructions, adaptable to diverse experimental conditions.

-   **Objective**: To investigate the specific role of well-defined $\Sigma$3(111) grain boundaries (GBs) in facilitating hydrogen insertion and metal hydride formation in palladium nanostructures.
-   **Finding**: The study found that palladium (Pd) nanostructures enriched with $\Sigma$3(111) GBs exhibited dramatically accelerated hydriding and dehydriding kinetics compared to other Pd nanoparticles. Environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) was used for strain mapping, which revealed that strain is highly localized at GBs and intensifies upon hydrogen exposure, indicating preferential hydrogen insertion along these sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported these findings, showing that hydrogen insertion near $\Sigma$3(111) GBs is energetically more favorable and that tensile strain lowers insertion barriers. These atomic-level insights, significantly aided by ETEM, suggest new design strategies for GB-engineered Pd-based functional materials.

This pulse compression mechanism is robust to laser pulse duration but sensitive to the initial momentum spread of the particles/beams. The proposed mechanism for achieving electron pulses in zeptosecond time scales offers potential for ultrafast coherent control of quantum states, opening new avenues in high-resolution temporal structuring of electron beams for time-resolved quantum technologies and attosecond-zeptosecond science, as well as for application in high-resolution electron microscopy.

A machine learning framework (combining random forest and convolutional neural networks) was developed to decode HAADF images and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected, demonstrating a material-agnostic framework for tailoring atomic-level defect structures using STEM.

-   **Authors**: Hao Geng, Qiaofei Pan, Jian Kang, Yiming Pan
-   **Date**: 2025-07-01
-   **Objective**: To propose a novel approach to mitigate space-charge interactions in high-intensity ultrafast electron beams by treating electrons as a strongly correlated Fermi gas and inducing a photon-mediated attractive force.
-   **Finding**: The study proposes a photon-induced pairing mechanism that generates a net attractive force between two electrons, thereby forming "flying bound states" analogous to Cooper pairs. Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), it is demonstrated that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability mediated by structured electromagnetic fields at near-resonant velocity matching regimes. This theoretical work, relevant to advanced electron microscopy techniques like PINEM, underscores the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, which can further enhance beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electrons.
