-   **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
-   **Date**: 2025-09-26
-   **Objective**: To investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten and sublimation of tungsten oxide to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
-   **Finding**: The study observed the formation of voids and cracks in W at temperatures above $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, leading to dust or oxide spalling, and characterized preferential oxidation at specimen edges. **Electron microscopy** and Raman spectroscopy revealed a three-layered oxide scale: an inner 30-50 nm thick WO2 layer, a middle 10-20 $\mu$m WO$_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer WO$_{2.9}$/WO3 layer, with thickness varying with the total oxide scale.

**34. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
-   **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
-   **Date**: 2025-09-25
-   **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome the limitations of speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging.
-   **Finding**: The study proved that SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes is fundamentally impossible with sequential measurements suffering from per-measurement-independent speckle. They developed a snapshot SA imaging method that overcomes this, and remarkably, demonstrated in simulation that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information, improving resolution in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures. While focusing on light-based imaging, these advancements in synthetic aperture techniques could inspire similar developments in **electron microscopy** for enhanced resolution and noise resilience.

-   **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24
-   **Objective**: To investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$ at ambient conditions.
-   **Finding**: The study revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices in UTe$_{2}$ with no uranium vacancies but observed tiny amounts of interstitial defects on the Te2 layers. These defects are argued to cause slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state. **Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** measurements, alongside single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD), were crucial for identifying these interstitial defects and characterizing the crystalline structure.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-23
-   **Objective**: To introduce the SOft X-ray Ptychography Highly Integrated Endstation (SOPHIE) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) and provide an overview of its instrumentation and capabilities for soft X-ray ptychography.

The instrumentation was detailed, and an example demonstrated the achievement of sub-5 nm spatial resolution at a photon energy of 706 eV. While this paper focuses on X-ray ptychography, the technique is directly analogous and often compared to **electron ptychography** in **electron microscopy**, sharing similar principles for high-resolution imaging.

-   **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
-   **Date**: 2025-09-22

-   **Finding**: The study found that **scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** consistently delivered the highest contrast for DNA origami, with optimal performance using a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at a camera length of 600 mm. Contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining, which also largely retained the structural integrity and designated dimensions of 3D molds, establishing STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami, even for unstained samples.

These phenomena were demonstrated using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in **ultrafast electron microscopy**, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, enabling probing topological defect dynamics at previously unattainable timescales.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-20
-   **Objective**: To observe and understand size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes.
-   **Finding**: The study observed a melting point depression of CDWs for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm, and an absence of CDWs in very small flakes, consistent with classical nucleation theory. **In-situ cryogenic electron microscopy** with temperature down to 20 K was used to perform these observations, revealing that the finite flake size cuts off the divergence of the CDW correlation length, limiting long-range order and lowering the transition temperature.

-   **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
-   **Date**: 2025-09-19
-   **Objective**: To develop corrections for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging artifacts (high acceleration voltage and metal coatings) to accurately estimate true surface pore size and porosity in nanoporous membranes.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings in **SEM** systematically underestimate porosity and pore size. They developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, yielding uncoated porosity values up to 3-fold greater and mean pore diameters up to 2-fold greater than conventionally measured values, which agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data. They recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation for future nanoscale pore analysis using **SEM**.
