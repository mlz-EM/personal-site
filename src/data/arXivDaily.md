- **Objective**: To design artificial sulfur-free zinc phosphate tribofilms with tailored mechanical properties by controlling their chain length through thermal annealing.
- **Finding**: The study showed that increasing the annealing temperature reduced the chain lengths of the zinc phosphate coatings, transforming them from metaphosphates towards orthophosphates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line scans confirmed that the composition change observed on the surface by XPS extended throughout the entire thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length caused a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and improved wear resistance, enabling the design of coatings with desired mechanical properties.

These techniques revealed the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, providing new insights into strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers.

- **Authors**: Rahil Hosseinifar, Felix Steinbach, Ivar Kumberg, José Miguel Lendínez, Sangeeta Thakur, Sebastien E. Hadjadj, Jendrik Gördes, Chowdhury S. Awsaf, Mario Fix, Manfred Albrecht, Florian Kronast, Unai Atxitia, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Wolfgang Kuch
- **Date**: 2025-06-12
- **Objective**: To investigate the speed and frequency limits of all-optical magnetization switching in a GdFe ferrimagnetic alloy using double-pulse laser excitation.

For shorter delays ($<$ 2 ps), the effects of the two pulses added up, enabling switching at fluences below the single-pulse threshold. PEEM and Kerr microscopy were essential for directly visualizing and characterizing the ultrafast magnetic domain reversal.

TEM was crucial for identifying two distinct in-plane relationships between ScN(113) and AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$, providing detailed structural information at the interface. This comprehensive structural characterization is vital for understanding and tailoring the functionalities of transition-metal nitrides for device integration.

**37. [Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09355v1)**
- **Authors**: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
- **Date**: 2025-06-11
- **Objective**: To explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and develop approaches to optimize its $Z$-sensitivity.
- **Finding**: The study showed that ptychography's $Z$-dependence is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column considered. A monotonic $Z$-dependence was found for small integration areas, while larger areas led to non-monotonic $Z$-contrast following orbital shell-structure trends. This non-monotonic behavior, demonstrated for $\beta$-CuZn ($Z$ = 29 and 30) in samples over 20 nm thick, can be used to accentuate contrast between elements differing by only a single atomic number, highlighting the utility of electron ptychography for optimized $Z$-contrast.

The predicted morphologies were found to be in good agreement with experimental observations performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). TEM was essential for validating the theoretical predictions by providing direct visualization of the crystal morphologies, thereby supporting the method's potential for optimizing hetero-structured materials.

- **Authors**: Cheng-Yu Chen, Duncan Burns, Peter W. Voorhees, Eric A. Stach
- **Date**: 2025-06-04
- **Objective**: To investigate the dynamics and coalescence behavior of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles on dynamically evolving, heterogeneous silicon nitride (SiN$_{x}$) substrates.
- **Finding**: The study employed in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe Pt nanoparticle dynamics. It revealed that Pt nanoparticles in contact with electron beam-induced crystalline silicon (Si) nanodomains transformed into a more mobile platinum silicide (Pt$_{3}$Si) phase. Strikingly, these Pt$_{3}$Si nanoparticles exhibited pronounced directional migration away from the Si pads, driven by interfacial energy gradients, rather than stochastic Brownian motion. In situ TEM was crucial for directly visualizing and understanding these dynamic, directed migration and coalescence pathways at the nanoscale.

- **Authors**: Seokjo Hong, Jaewhan Oh, Woohyun Cho, Soyoung Lee, Colin Ophus, Yeongkwan Kim, Heejun Yang, SungBin Lee, Yongsoo Yang
- **Date**: 2025-06-03
- **Objective**: To directly access local amplitude correlations of charge density wave (CDW) order in 2H-NbSe$_{2}$ using cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM).
- **Finding**: Cryogenic 4D-STEM measurements, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling, allowed for mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution. By analyzing their autocorrelations, the study extracted the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, revealing that weak short-range amplitude correlations persist above the transition temperature. 4D-STEM proved to be a powerful tool for probing spatially inhomogeneous electronic order in quantum materials, providing insights into local amplitude correlations previously challenging to access.

**49. [Influence of X-ray Irradiation on the Magnetic and Structural Properties of Gadolinium Silicide Nanoparticles for Self-Regulating Hyperthermia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00293v1)**
- **Authors**: Samantha E. Smith, Santiago Bermudez, Pavan Chaitanya, Zoe Boekelheide, Jessika Rojas Marin, Ravi L. Hadimani
- **Date**: 2025-05-30
- **Objective**: To examine the impact of high-dose X-ray irradiation on the magnetic and structural properties of Gd$_{5}$Si$_{4}$ nanoparticles, a promising candidate for magnetic hyperthermia treatment.
- **Finding**: While X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy confirmed no significant structural or compositional changes, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed localized lattice distortions, which correlated with observable changes in magnetic properties (magnetization vs. temperature and hysteresis). Despite these changes, magnetocaloric properties and specific loss power remained unaffected. TEM was crucial for identifying the subtle, localized lattice distortions that were not detectable by other techniques, providing a deeper understanding of the material's response to irradiation.

**50. [Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176v1)**
- **Authors**: J. M. Gibson, Robe Elliman, T. Susi, C. Mangler
- **Date**: 2025-05-30
- **Objective**: To study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si) formed by self-ion implantation amorphization, particularly focusing on Medium-Range Order (MRO) and structural relaxation.
- **Finding**: Using Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM), the study found that the degree of MRO in a-Si first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before final recrystallization. FEM consistently observed MRO that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. The technique revealed that high-dose implantation increases defect density, which anneals out at 500$^{\circ}$C, leading to a metastable, highly-ordered paracrystalline (PC) structure independent of initial implantation conditions. FEM, a specialized electron microscopy technique, was central to characterizing the MRO and its evolution during annealing.
