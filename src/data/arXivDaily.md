- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To investigate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) and hysteretic output conductance in $In_{2}Se_{3}$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and understand the underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios in $In_{2}Se_{3}$ FeS-FETs, attributing it to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance $\alpha$-2H phase to a high-resistance state. High-resolution electron microscopy was used for atomic-scale ex-situ imaging, revealing that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moiré patterns), and intralayer shear, leading to stress-induced phase transitions. This work highlights the promise of 2D ferroelectric devices for multifunctional nanoelectronics while also identifying intrinsic limitations for conventional ferroelectric memory applications.

The 4DSTEM characterization revealed a complex transformation process from $1T$ to $1T'$ resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure. The $1T'$ $CrS_{2}$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperatures, shedding light on the magnetic properties of this predicted material and paving the way for scalable synthesis of 2D magnets.

- **Finding**: The researchers successfully solved the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer $WSe_{2}$ with picometer-scale accuracy using multislice electron ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation. The resulting atomic models visualized each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each $WSe_{2}$ layer, variations in interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies (exclusively in outer Se planes).

- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and underlying mechanisms in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: The study found that hydrogen pre-charging leads to brittle fracture in 1.5 GPa DP steel within the elastic regime. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and confirmed $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking during significant crack growth. Transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies further supported these findings. The research explained HE via a hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where hydrogen diffusion to grain boundaries causes decohesion, and subsequent diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity, inhibiting crack blunting and ensuring sustained brittle crack growth.

- **Authors**: Tomoya Nakatani, Nattamon Suwannaharn, Taisuke Sasaki
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To fabricate single-crystalline CoSn thin films and investigate their anisotropic electrical resistivity with respect to crystallographic orientation for potential interconnect applications.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films was achieved on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer at deposition temperatures above 350 $^\circ C$. The films exhibited relatively low resistivity ($\rho$) along [0001] (13 $\mu\Omega$ cm) and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of $\rho$ between [0001] and [2-1-10], consistent with bulk CoSn. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that the CoSn(10-10) surface exhibited pronounced roughness, attributed to three-dimensional crystal growth during sputtering, with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets and domain boundaries, highlighting both the potential and challenges for CoSn in future interconnect technologies.

- **Objective**: To investigate the epitaxial growth of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy and characterize their structural and electronic properties.
- **Finding**: A high substrate growth temperature of 825 $^\circ C$ induced optimal structural properties of the 2H-TaS$_2$ overlayer, as revealed by in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The 2D-overlayer grew unstrained after monolayer deposition, but scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provided evidence of pits at the interface, likely due to GaN thermal decomposition. In-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) showed core level shifts consistent with electron transfer from n-GaN(0001) to 2H-TaS$_2$ and the formation of nitrogen vacancies near the interface, while corroborating no chemical reaction, suggesting the possibility of integrating 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with GaN.

**30. [Titanium for rare-event searches: Hydrofluoric acid-free etching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21029v1)**
- **Authors**: P. Knights, K. Nikolopoulos, G. Rogers, D. Spathara, P. Walters
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To develop an alternative hydrofluoric acid-free chemical etching method for titanium, suitable for use in rare-event search experiments where high radiopurity and safety are critical.
- **Finding**: An alternative chemical etching method using sulphuric acid was developed and demonstrated to effectively etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\mu m$ of material from the surface over 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the surface and contamination of the titanium, demonstrating the removal of surface contaminants after etching. This proposed method offers a potential alternative to conventional hydrofluoric acid etching, which presents serious health risks, for preparing titanium components in radiopurity-sensitive applications.

- **Authors**: Chenyang Yin, Lei Cao, Xue Bai, Suqin He, Hengbo Zhang, Tomas Duchon, Felix Gunkel, Yunxia Zhou, Mao Wang, Anton Kaus, Janghyun Jo, Rafal E. Dunin-Borkowski, Shengqiang Zhou, Thomas Brückel, Oleg Petracic
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To investigate an efficient oxygen getter assisted thermal annealing method using aluminum to induce a topotactic phase transition from Perovskite (PV) to Brownmillerite (BM) in epitaxial $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3-\delta}$ thin films.
- **Finding**: A very efficient thermal vacuum annealing method using aluminum as an oxygen getter material successfully triggered the topotactic phase transition from PV to BM in $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3-\delta}$ thin films, confirmed by X-ray Diffraction. This transition was accompanied by a change from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic state and a simultaneous transition from a metallic to an insulating state. X-ray Reflectivity, Atomic Force Microscopy, and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) revealed surface segregation and cation redistribution during the oxygen getter assisted annealing process, providing insights into the mechanism of oxygen vacancy-induced phase transitions and their impact on physical properties.

**32. [Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20930v1)**
- **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the interplay of interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain in controlling polarization and stabilizing polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films grown on charged-surface-terminated $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_3$ (LSMO)-buffered $NdGaO_3$(001) substrates.
- **Finding**: Large anisotropic compressive strain from the substrate promoted the formation of ferroelectric domains despite the expected stabilization of uniform out-of-plane polarization by the LSMO buffer. Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed that the resulting nanoscale domain architecture was stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like $Bi_2O_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization. By inserting a $Bi_2O_2$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer layer, a uniform out-of-plane polarization was stabilized. Additionally, signatures of homochiral polarization textures were revealed using local polarization switching experiments, offering new strategies for controlling polarization direction and chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics.

**33. [Prediction of EDS Maps from 4DSTEM Diffraction Patterns Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20657v1)**
- **Authors**: Mridul Kumar, Yevgeny Rakita
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To develop a machine learning framework that predicts energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps directly from 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) diffraction patterns, aiming to reduce beam exposure and acquisition time.
- **Finding**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed that accurately infers elemental compositions from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations, such as Oxygen and Tellurium. Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies demonstrated consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural context was available. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirmed the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends, establishing a data-driven pathway to non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization.

**34. [Toughening $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ via mechanically seeded dislocations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20439v1)**
- **Authors**: Zanlin Cheng, Jiawen Zhang, Peng Gao, Guosong Zeng, Xufei Fang, Wenjun Lu
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To explore a new approach to improve the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations through surface scratching.
- **Finding**: By applying a Brinell indenter to scratch the surface along the [100] direction, edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems were effectively generated within a mesoscale wear track. Through a combination of nanoindentation tests, surface morphology analysis, and microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it was revealed that the introduction of these dislocations significantly mitigated the formation of cleavage cracks during indentation, in contrast to as-received $\beta-Ga_2O_3$. The mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers played an important role in preventing brittle fracture by facilitating stable plastic deformation.

**35. [3D Strain Field Reconstruction by Inversion of Dynamical Scattering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18897v2)**
- **Authors**: Laura Niermann, Tore Niermann, Chengyu Song, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-08-26
- **Objective**: To present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM, based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects that occur at strain field variations along the electron beam direction.
- **Finding**: The developed method successfully reconstructs 3D strain fields by inverting dynamical diffraction effects observed in 4D-STEM data. The method was tested against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrated its application to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown $Al_{0.47}Ga_{0.53}N$ layer. This approach addresses a major challenge in (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) by enabling the measurement of strain variations along the electron beam direction, which is crucial for a detailed understanding and further developments of material properties through strain engineering.

- **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced thin-film fabrication, switching dynamics characterizations, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that previously observed broad transitional regions in STEM images, interpreted as transient nonpolar intermediate phases, are actually projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, which are a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. This was further confirmed by STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched $Al_{0.75}Sc_{0.25}N$ thin films. Simulations revealed that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly explaining the zigzag-shaped domain walls and nucleation-limited switching behavior, and showing that increasing Sc content lowers domain wall energy and switching fields.

- **Authors**: Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by either global annealing or localized laser-induced heating, focusing on the structural and electronic properties relevant for phase-change memory applications.
- **Finding**: The study observed that highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis investigated the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface. The clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through the segregation of a minor $GeSe_2$ phase, was proposed as the key mechanism. A high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^7$ between $\gamma$-GeSe and $\alpha$-GeSe was observed, underscoring its potential as a model polymorphic system for electronic applications.

**38. [Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17085v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: To investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations within the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand the underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study presented a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon where Shockley partial dislocations (a/6<112>) cross-slip from one {111} plane to another {111} conjugate plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterized stacking faults, dislocations, and associated chemical fluctuations. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing the energies of stacking faults and dislocations. Local stress concentrations also played a critical role. The formation of sessile stair-rod dislocations via this mechanism enhances the alloy's high-temperature deformation resistance.

**39. [Optics for broadband x-ray ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16953v1)**
- **Authors**: Wiebe Stolp, Silvia Cipiccia, Darren Batey, Matthieu Boone
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: To analyze the limitations of current optics in conventional x-ray ptychography for broadband illumination and energy-resolving detectors, and to consider alternative optics that can maximize photon detection rates and broaden the tolerable bandwidth.
- **Finding**: Conventional x-ray ptychography, typically using monochromatic illumination and Fresnel zone plates, is constrained to 3rd and 4th generation synchrotron sources and long scanning times due to spectral bandwidth limitations. While broadband illumination with energy-resolving detectors offers faster spectral imaging, current detectors saturate below synchrotron flux rates. The study analyzes this problem and considers alternative optics that can both maximize the total photon detection rates and broaden the tolerable bandwidth. This work aims to enable broadband x-ray ptychography to dramatically reduce data collection times at synchrotron sources and potentially transition the technique into a laboratory setting.

- **Authors**: N. I. Berezovska, I. M. Dmitruk, Ye. S. Hrabovskyi, R. S. Kolodka, O. P. Stanovyi, A. M. Dmytruk, I. V. Blonskyi
- **Date**: 2025-08-22
- **Objective**: To study the impact of femtosecond (fs) laser radiation on the surface morphology of various direct and indirect band gap semiconductors in a multi-pulse regime in air.
- **Finding**: Femtosecond laser treatment (800 nm, 130-150 fs) induced both low spatial frequency (LSFL) and high spatial frequency (HSFL) laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on semiconductors like ZnSe, GaAs, CdZnTe, PbI2, GaSe, and Si. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 2D Fourier transform of SEM images were used to analyze specific features of LIPSS and other structural peculiarities (grooves, grains, defects, ablation products). The formation mechanisms of LIPSS were considered within electromagnetic and matter reorganization approaches, providing insights into fs-laser surface structuring.

- **Date**: 2025-08-21
- **Objective**: To design novel Co-Ni-Mo-Al medium-entropy alloys with L12 nanoprecipitates by systematically altering Al content, aiming to achieve superior strength and ductility, and to reveal the underlying strengthening mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The (CoNi)$_{81}$Mo$_{12}$Al$_7$ alloy achieved exceptional mechanical properties (yield strength 1086 MPa, tensile strength 1520 MPa, ductility 35%). Dislocation analysis via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations, demonstrated that Mo substitution for Al in the L12 phase altered dislocation behavior, promoting multiple deformation modes including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These behaviors are facilitated by the low stacking fault energy (SFE) of the FCC matrix, overlapping of SFs, and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries, demonstrating a novel strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs through precipitation hardening.

- **Date**: 2025-08-20
- **Objective**: To explore erbium-doped calcium molybdate ($CaMoO_4$) thin films as a potential solid-state system for C-band quantum emitters for quantum network applications, focusing on their microstructural, optical, and microwave properties.
- **Finding**: Molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments identified an incorporation-limited deposition regime enabling a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio and single-phase $CaMoO_4$ formation, which could be in-situ doped with Er. Electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and reflection electron diffraction studies showed polycrystalline films on silicon but high-quality epitaxial single-crystalline films on YSZ substrates. Preliminary optical and microwave characterization of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial $CaMoO_4$ annealed thin films extracted an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz, confirming its potential for quantum applications.

- **Date**: 2025-08-19
- **Objective**: To fabricate and provide definitive evidence for the formation of single-variant altermagnetic $RuO_2$(101) thin films with fully epitaxial growth on $Al_2O_3$(1-102) r-plane substrates, crucial for spintronic applications.
- **Finding**: Rigorous structural analyses using X-ray diffraction, atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism confirmed the formation of single-variant altermagnetic $RuO_2$(101) thin films. The mutual correspondence of oxygen atom occupancy on the surfaces of $RuO_2$(101)[010] and $Al_2O_3$(1-102)[11-20] played a decisive role in single-variant formation, supported by first-principles density functional theory calculations. Spin-splitting magnetoresistance was further observed in the single-variant $RuO_2$(101)/CoFeB bilayers, highlighting the characteristic effect of single variant on spin transport and marking a significant advancement in the field of altermagnetism.

- **Authors**: Men Guo, Gilad Orr, Paul Ben Ishai, Xia Zhao, Shlomo Glasser
- **Date**: 2025-08-18
- **Objective**: To fabricate Cr-doped ZnO films using a new method of annealing Cr-Zn layers deposited via DC magnetron sputtering in air, and to investigate their structural, optical, and dielectric properties.
- **Finding**: Cr-doped ZnO films were successfully fabricated by annealing Cr-Zn layers. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that average grain sizes decreased (56.34 - 39.50 nm) with increasing Cr. Photoluminescence spectroscopy identified intrinsic point defects. Optical and dielectric measurements revealed that the band gap increased (from 3.18 to 3.23 eV) and transmittance (at 600 nm) decreased (from 91% to 83%) with increasing Cr. Two activation energies of conduction increased after Cr doping, indicating enhanced temperature stability. At optimal Cr levels, ZnO films exhibited high transmittance and conductivity, showing potential for transparent electrode development.

- **Authors**: Michael Deimetry, Timothy C. Petersen, Matthew Weyland, Scott D. Findlay
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of small concentrations of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure.
- **Finding**: Through simulation, the study showed that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns are robust for measuring dopant site occupancy. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, core-loss PACBED patterns were interpreted using a strategy traditionally employed for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. While differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification, this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors, providing a robust method for dopant site occupancy determination.

- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Objective**: To present a generic and versatile workflow for operando biasing of thin-film capacitors in the (scanning) transmission electron microscope, specifically for devices grown on non-conductive substrates, while preserving their original film structure and boundary conditions.
- **Finding**: The developed workflow enables operando electron microscopy studies of nanoscale electronic devices on non-conductive substrates by introducing a patterned insulating barrier adjacent to bulk-characterized capacitors, allowing sample preparation without altering the original film structure. As a case study, the method was applied to a piezoelectric thin-film capacitor, demonstrating the preservation of boundary-condition-sensitive domain switching at the atomic scale under applied electric fields. This process establishes a foundation for systematic operando studies of complex thin-film systems under representative bulk testing geometries.

- **Date**: 2025-08-15
- **Objective**: To comprehensively characterize the structural features of commercially available alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AEM) polymers (Fumasep FAA-3 and IRA 900) for low-energy, moisture-driven direct air capture (DAC) applications.
- **Finding**: A multi-technique approach including X-ray diffraction, small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed molecular ordering and large-scale structural organization in both AEM polymers. Humidity-induced changes highlighted the impact of moisture on structural properties, with AFM, FIB-SEM, and TEM imaging corroborating the presence of clustering, porosity, and swelling. These structural insights offer a deeper understanding of AEM-DAC materials' behavior during $CO_2$ capture and release, emphasizing moisture's role and laying a foundation for more energy-efficient DAC polymer development.

- **Date**: 2025-08-15
- **Objective**: To propose and investigate $ZrO_x$ as an alternative low-barrier tunnel barrier material for Nb-based Josephson junctions, aiming for scalability and applications like merged-element transmons.
- **Finding**: Theoretical estimations indicated excellent oxygen retention for zirconium oxide, and experiments confirmed no significant oxygen diffusion into adjacent Nb electrodes. A top-down fabrication process for Nb/Zr-$ZrO_x$/Nb Josephson junctions was developed. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experimentally found that, depending on Zr thickness, $ZrO_x$ tunnel barriers can be fully crystalline with chemically abrupt interfaces with niobium. Further analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) revealed that $ZrO_x$ corresponds to tetragonal $ZrO_2$. Room temperature characterization using Simmons' model showed a low tunnel barrier height, and low-temperature transport measurements revealed sub-gap structure with megaohm-range sub-gap resistance, promising for merged-element transmon applications.

- **Finding**: The synthesized MXene/PNIPAAm composite exhibited a tunable porous structure, significantly enhanced stability against oxidation-induced degradation of MXene over three months, and tunable electronic states responsive to gas interactions, even in a dried state. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and rheology assessed microstructural and mechanical properties, confirming the controllable 3D spatial arrangement of MXene instead of the prevalent stacked-sheet structure. Chemiresistive measurements demonstrated its potential for VOC sensing (acetone), revealing novel material effects and properties that address key MXene challenges and enhance hydrogel sensing capabilities in gaseous environments.

- **Finding**: Electron ptychography, a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) technique, successfully imaged the 3D distribution of H atoms in $PdH_x$ nanocubes. The study observed an unexpected one-dimensional superlattice ordering of hydrogen and 3D hydrogen clustering in localized regions within the $PdH_x$ nanocubes. These findings reveal spatial heterogeneity in metal hydride nanoparticles previously inaccessible by other methods, providing crucial insights into hydrogen's location and ordering, which are vital for understanding and predicting the physical and electronic properties of metal hydrides.
