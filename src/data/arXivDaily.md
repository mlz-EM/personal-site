- **Authors**: F. Liu, Z. Yang, Y. Luo, S. Guo, C. Zhang, S. Choo, X. Xu, X. Wang, K. A. Mkhoyan, M. Bernardi, B. Jalan
- **Date**: 2025-10-08
- **Objective**: Characterize intrinsic polaronic transport in anatase $TiO_{2}$ films by combining precise synthesis and first-principles many-body theory.
- **Finding**: High-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase $TiO_{2}$ films exhibited record-high electron mobility, which was in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations predicting a room-temperature mobility of $45 \pm 15 \text{ cm}^{2}\text{V}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$ and a mobility-temperature scaling of mobility proportional to $T^{-1.9 \pm 0.077}$. Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in modulating transport at lower temperatures, providing a microscopic understanding of large-polaron transport.

- **Authors**: Luke Besley, P. S. Jørgensen, A. Diaz, C. Detlefs, S. De Angelis, M. Carlsen, B. Chang, C. Silvestre, J. W. Andreasen
- **Date**: 2025-10-08

- **Finding**: A ptychographic reconstruction framework was developed, replacing the single-scattering model with a multislice wave-propagation formalism tailored for grazing incidence, which overcomes the projection approximation's failure to capture significant multiple scattering. This framework, applied to both experimental and simulated datasets, enables simultaneous phase retrieval and reconstruction, supports multiple incidence and rotation angles, and recovers complex surface and near-surface nanostructures without strong structural priors.

- **Finding**: The densities for four predicted partial dislocations in ZnS were quantified using scanning electron microscopy-based electron channeling contrast imaging (SEM-ECCI). Room-temperature ellipsometry revealed absorption peaks that scaled with dislocation density and aligned with theoretical predictions, while low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed deep emission peaks matching dislocation 1D band-to-band transitions, supporting the existence of efficient, 1D radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core states.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: Report a novel $\beta^{p}$ phase of indium selenide exhibiting room-temperature ferroelectricity in large-area films.
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis revealed a unique $\beta^{p}$ phase of indium selenide in synthesized large-area films, characterized by a zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths and intralayer shifting, distinct from any previously reported phase. Cross-sectional STEM confirmed this unique layer structure, and the films displayed electric-field-induced switchable polarization characteristic of ferroelectric materials, further supported by nonlinear optical Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses, indicating broken inversion symmetry and ferroelectricity at room temperature.

- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: Investigate the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface.
- **Finding**: Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements revealed spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations attributed this magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface, thereby revealing a mechanism for inducing magnetism without inherently magnetic components.

**8. [Observation of a Novel CDW Superstructure in Monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at Room Temperature and its Evolution in Multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03800v1)**
- **Authors**: Samanta Pal, Kaustuv Chatterjee, A. K. Raychaudhuri, Prabir Pal
- **Date**: 2025-10-04
- **Objective**: Observe and characterize a novel charge density wave (CDW) superstructure in monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at room temperature and its evolution in multilayers.
- **Finding**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) revealed the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases in $VS_{2}$ at room temperature, with only the 1T phase undergoing a CDW transition. A novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) $R19.1^{\circ}$ was discovered in monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$, which evolved into a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure with increasing layers. Angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy showed that vanadium self-intercalates as $V^{3+}$ ions in multilayer $VS_{2}$, responsible for this CDW superstructure evolution.

- **Finding**: An in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation in cold-worked 5052 aluminum alloy was performed using scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The study found that microstructure-sensitive cracks grow in a quasi-brittle manner at low energy release rates until a critical energy release rate is reached, where the crack's process zone becomes large enough to invoke plastic deformation that blunts the crack, marking a transition from elastically driven, microstructure-sensitive propagation to plasticity-dominated crack arrest.

- **Finding**: Up to 180 nm thick (111)-oriented FeO heteroepitaxial films were successfully grown on slightly lattice-matched 4H-SiC(0001) using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) collectively confirmed the epilayer as phase-pure wüstite FeO, with atomically sharp FeO/SiC interfaces, demonstrating the power of epitaxial stabilization for integrating this thermodynamically unstable material with a technologically important semiconductor platform.

- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: Investigate the reversal of strain state in a $V_{2}O_{3}$ Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology.
- **Finding**: Minute changes in sapphire substrate morphology, induced by simple annealing to create either flat or stepped surfaces, allowed the thermal expansion mismatch-induced tensile strain to overcome the lattice mismatch-induced compressive strain in $V_{2}O_{3}$ films. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) was used to image atomic steps in the substrate and adjacent crystallographic defects in the $V_{2}O_{3}$, elucidating the strain relaxation mechanism and offering a hitherto underexplored method to tune strain and metal-insulator transition behavior.

**13. [Electron-beam-induced Contactless Manipulation of Interlayer Twist in van der Waals Heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03347v1)**
- **Authors**: Nicola Curreli, Tero S. Kulmala, Riya Sebait, Nicolò Petrini, Matteo Bruno Lodi, Roman Furrer, Alessandro Fanti, Michel Calame, Ilka Kriegel
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Objective**: Demonstrate contactless manipulation of interlayer twist in van der Waals heterostructures using electron-beam-induced charge injection.
- **Finding**: A proof-of-concept demonstration showed that locally charging an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on an electrically grounded graphene layer using an electron beam creates an interfacial electric field, which generates in-plane electrostatic torque and induces angular displacement. In-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy validated the induced rotation, establishing a contactless actuation method for dynamically controlling the relative orientation of layers in 2D van der Waals heterostructures.

**14. [Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493v1)**
- **Authors**: Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
- **Date**: 2025-10-01
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how aberrations can be used to improve dose-efficient tilt-corrected 4D-STEM imaging.
- **Finding**: Aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and differential phase contrast (tcDPC) images, enables continuously non-zero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. The study shows that at Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF contrast transfer function, leading to superior performance compared to tcBF or DPC alone in both simulated and experimental data.

An adaptive sampling strategy was introduced to prioritize images from domain wall regions, reducing the number of training images required while improving accuracy and interpretability. This approach was demonstrated for domain mapping in ferroelectric boracite, $Cu_{3}B_{7}O_{13}Cl$, providing an efficient tool for identifying atomic-scale structural variations governing macroscopic functionalities.

- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Objective**: Control the shell morphology of $MoSe_{2}$ and $WSe_{2}$ on ZnSe-based core-shell nanowires through temperature optimization during a two-step growth process.
- **Finding**: ZnSe-MoSe2 and ZnSe-WSe2 core-shell nanowires were successfully fabricated, and it was observed that the TMD shell morphology could be controlled by optimizing the selenization process temperature, arising from different growth mechanisms. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the as-grown nanostructures, offering promising avenues for advanced nanoscale applications.

- **Authors**: Naisargi Kanabar, Seiichiro Higashiya, Daniele Cherniak, Devendra Sadana, Stephen Bedell, Haralabos Efstathiadis
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Objective**: Examine lithium distribution and its evolution in both anode and cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate cycling.
- **Finding**: Post-mortem analysis using Li nuclear reaction analysis (Li-NRA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed a surface lithium peak on the anode, likely associated with SEI formation and lithium plating, while the cathode exhibited a decrease in lithium content by $\sim 19.7\%$. XRD analysis of the cathode showed a contraction of the c-lattice parameter and peak shifts consistent with lithium depletion and structural deformation, supported by SEM imaging, highlighting the impact of lithium plating on cell performance.

**19. [Electrical resistivity of microstructural components in Al-Mg-Si alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25089v1)**
- **Authors**: Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: Investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and microstructure on the electrical resistivity of overaged Al-Mg-Si alloys.
- **Finding**: The crystal structure, composition, and microstructure were characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A microscale four-point probe setup inside an SEM directly measured the electrical resistivity of microstructural components (Al solid solution matrix, Si, and $Mg_{2}Si$ precipitates), revealing that the Al solid solution matrix is up to 15% more resistive than pure Al depending on heat treatment, and regions including Si or $Mg_{2}Si$ precipitates are equally resistive.

**20. [Nanoscale Polar Landscapes in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24969v1)**
- **Authors**: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: Directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric $SrTiO_{3}$.
- **Finding**: Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) down to 20 K directly imaged a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains with finite polarization in $SrTiO_{3}$. High-resolution imaging revealed that short-range polar domains initially grow and self-organize into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers. However, this process reverses when entering the quantum paraelectric regime below 40 K, causing the periodically ordered polar nanodomains to fragment into small clusters.

**21. [Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269v1)**
- **Authors**: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman

- **Finding**: The study demonstrated the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated, simplified 2D variant of position-blind ptychography using variational inference with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion models. It found that with the right illumination structure and a strong prior, reliable and successful image reconstructions can be achieved even under measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

- **Authors**: Shelby S. Fields, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Cory D. Cress, Nicholas G. Combs, Olaf van 't Erve, Patrick G. Callahan, Keith E. Knipling, Michelle E. Jamer, Frank M. Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: Investigate the non-altermagnetic origin of exchange bias (EB) behaviors in incoherent $RuO_{2}$/Fe bilayer heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron reflectometry, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and SQUID measurements revealed that the exchange bias (EB) behavior in Ru-capped $RuO_{2}$/Fe bilayers is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing $Fe_{3}O_{4}$. This interlayer undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature, indicating that EB in this system is due to interfacial chemical disorder rather than altermagnetic ordering in $RuO_{2}$.

- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: Investigate the oxidation of pure Tungsten in air and its impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
- **Finding**: Pure W oxidized at temperatures between 400 and 1050°C showed the formation of voids and cracks above 600°C, leading to dust or oxide spalling. Characterization using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: an inner 30-50 nm thick $WO_{2}$ oxide, a middle 10-20 $\mu m$ of $WO_{2.72}$, and an outer layer formed of $WO_{2.9}/WO_{3}$ phases whose thickness varied. This observed microstructure was discussed in relation to parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation.

**25. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: Develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that can overcome speckle noise limitations in macroscale light-based SA imaging.
- **Finding**: The study first demonstrated that speckle noise fundamentally limits SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes if one captures sequential measurements that suffer from per-measurement-independent speckle. It then developed a snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy that successfully overcomes this limitation. Remarkably, simulations further showed that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, thereby improving resolution.

- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the low-temperature MOCVD synthesis of 2D InSe on c-plane sapphire substrates and optimize growth conditions for high-mobility material.
- **Finding**: The study established a phase diagram for InSe synthesis via MOCVD by varying Se/In precursor ratio and growth temperature. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed epitaxial alignment of the InSe with the sapphire substrate, mediated by a specific interface reconstruction, which was further verified by in-plane X-ray diffraction. Optimized samples showed strong optical absorption and comparably high electron mobility, underlining the potential of MOCVD-grown InSe for future applications.

**27. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$ at ambient conditions.
- **Finding**: Single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. However, tiny amounts of interstitial defects were observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. These defects are argued to give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$, highlighting the need for minimal structural disorder in future studies.

- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate imaging strategies for characterizing the structure of 3D DNA origami nanostructures, which are challenging to image due to their low atomic number, using transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study compared different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, and found that STEM consistently delivered the highest contrast, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. Contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate and palladium, which also preserved structural integrity. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami, even for unstained samples, and provide practical guidelines for reliable structural visualization.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To directly measure the ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles, capturing their phase-space correlations.
- **Finding**: The researchers observed that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities before annihilation, with measurements indicating velocities exceeding the speed of light, paradoxically amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes. These phenomena were demonstrated using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions each an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period, enabling probing topological defect dynamics at previously unattainable timescales.

- **Finding**: The study developed four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, a method for directly tracking 3D atomic rearrangements in identical nanoparticles by electrocatalytic reactions. Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles, atomic evolution throughout electrocatalytic cycles was captured, revealing two stages: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, corroborated by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. This technique identified atomic-level chemical short-range order and anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations, highlighting the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into nanocatalyst design.

- **Authors**: Ernst Artes, Primiana Cavallo, Tobias Häger, Carl-Christian Meyer, Christoph Mokry, Dennis Renisch, Jörg Runke, Evgenia Schaffner, Alice Seibert, Christina Trautmann, Christoph E. Düllmann
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Objective**: To elucidate a possible influence of water and carbon dioxide present in the plating solution on the quality and deposition yields of terbium and thulium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: The study found that water in the plating solution affects the quality of the thin films when its concentration exceeds 1 vol.-%, and the presence of $CO_2$ leads to an increased carbonate content, which negatively influences film quality. The morphology of the thin films was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, which, combined with chemical analysis via infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, revealed the formation of hydroxides, oxides, and carbonates under varying conditions.

- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To observe and understand size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes.
- **Finding**: Using in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperature down to 20 K, the researchers observed a melting point depression of CDW for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, a zero-temperature correlation length of 10–50 nm was estimated. As the flake size approaches this correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition is cut off, limiting long-range order and lowering the transition temperature, with CDWs even absent in very small flakes, demonstrating that an electronic phase transition follows classical nucleation theory.

**34. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To investigate and correct for the systematic underestimation of porosity and pore size in nanoporous membranes caused by high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings during scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging.
- **Finding**: The study showed that increasing SEM acceleration voltage and Pt coating thickness significantly reduced measured porosity and pore size. To account for coating artifacts, a digital correction method simulating pore dilation was developed, which estimated uncoated porosity values (23% for UF, 20% for RO support) to be about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating, and mean pore diameters 1.5-2-fold greater. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data, suggesting that true surface porosities and pore sizes are much larger than previously understood and recommending low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation for future nanoscale pore analysis.

- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To directly observe the polarization switching pathways by visualizing oxygen site dynamics at the atomic scale in fluorite ferroelectrics.
- **Finding**: Using an advanced atomic-column imaging technique, optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the researchers directly observed the 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involving different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales in ZrO$_2$ and Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ freestanding membranes. Coupled with density functional theory, these atomic-level insights revealed how different cation species impact the accessible polarization switching pathways, opening new avenues for the advanced engineering of fluorite ferroelectric materials and memory devices.

- **Objective**: To investigate coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope.
- **Finding**: Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup, the study successfully demonstrated ghost imaging of complex patterns within a transmission electron microscope. They achieved a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, paving the way for adaptation of quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy, leveraging the fundamentally different properties of massive, charged electrons and massless, neutral photons.

**37. [Characterization of superconducting germanide and germanosilicide films of Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir formed by solid-phase epitaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14173v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Li, Zhongxia Shang, Michael P. Lilly, Maksym Myronov, Leonid P. Rokhinson
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To conduct a comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir germanides, along with an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by solid-phase epitaxy.
- **Finding**: For Ir(Si)Ge films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, the study reported critical temperatures of $T_\mathrm{c}=3.4\,\mathrm{K}$ for IrGe and $2.6\,\mathrm{K}$ for IrSiGe. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface, providing crucial structural and compositional insights into these superconducting films and their interfaces.

Dunin-Borkowski, Michael Farle, Bai-Xiang Xu, Leopoldo Molina-Luna, Oliver Gutfleisch, Baptiste Gault, Konstantin Skokov
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Objective**: To investigate the underlying mechanism of substantial coercivity in Ce(Co$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$)$_{5}$ permanent magnets by identifying nanoscale pinning centers.
- **Finding**: Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), the researchers identified a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition in Ce(Co$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)$_{5.4}$ magnets. This structure consists of Cu-poor cylindrical cells and Cu-rich cell boundaries, with intrinsic Cu concentration gradients up to 12 at.% Cu/nm. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that these gradients lead to spatial variations in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity, providing a microstructural basis for "giant intrinsic magnetic hardness" in such systems.

- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To understand the underlying degradation mechanisms and improve the operational lifetimes of Cd-free colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs).
- **Finding**: The study observed nanoscale morphological changes, including interparticle coarsening and layer thinning, in the electron transport layer (ETL), QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer of InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs during operation, accompanied by the generation and diffusion of oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals. In situ transmission electron microscopy revealed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO nanoparticle coarsening. Acrylate-based resin-encapsulation stabilized the ETL/QD layers by suppressing radical formation and halting morphology changes, leading to dramatic lifetime enhancements (8-fold and 5000-fold respectively).

- **Authors**: Vijay Kumar, Kaitlyn M. Mullin, Hyunggon Park, Matthew Gerigk, Andrew Bresk, Tresa M. Pollock, Yangying Zhu
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Objective**: To accurately resolve extreme and transient thermal conditions during selective laser melting (SLM) in additive manufacturing by coupling high-speed infrared imaging with a transient three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics simulation.
- **Finding**: The integrated framework successfully reconstructed the dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool during SLM of MAR-M247, enabling the estimation of experimentally-validated 3D solidification conditions (including solidification velocities and cooling rates) at the solid-liquid interface while significantly lowering computational cost. Variations in microstructure size and orientation, predicted by these conditions, were validated with ex situ scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction maps, substantiating that an integrated experimental-computational approach is crucial for in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in commercial AM.

**41. [Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037v2)**
- **Authors**: Felix Bennemann, Angus I. Kirkland, David A. Muller, Peter Nellist
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To compare the fluence efficiency of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and ptychography phase imaging, especially for beam-sensitive materials, using the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
- **Finding**: By applying the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence-independent and sample-independent measure of technique performance, the study found that for a weak-phase object, ptychography cannot reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but is more robust to partial coherence. This work provides a valuable metric for evaluating the performance of imaging methods, particularly for electron ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and HRTEM.

**42. [Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO2(100) Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11568v1)**
- **Authors**: Songda Li, Chen Zou, Liuxi Chen, Zhong-Kang Han, Wentao Yuan, Hangsheng Yang, David J. Wales, Yong Wang
- **Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Objective**: To understand and control the atomic structure of the polar CeO$_2$(100) surface to unravel its surface reactivity and design advanced catalytic materials.
- **Finding**: Through an integrated approach combining global structure search, machine learning-based atomic potential models, DFT calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO$_2$(100) surface was discovered. This reconstructed surface, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ ions and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms, is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable. The formation of localized Ce$^{3+}$ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, activating these states and enhancing electron-donating capacity, which facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules like H$_2$O.

- **Authors**: Yonghao Weng, Liqiang Gao, Linwu Zhu, Jian Huang
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for systematically validating the capabilities of AI models in the specialized field of materials characterization and analysis.
- **Finding**: MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), with high-quality question-answer pairs generated using a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation. Preliminary evaluations showed that advanced multi-modal AI models achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis.

**44. [Intrinsic Quantum Clusters in Kagome Weyl Semimetal Co3Sn2S2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11230v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuqing Xing, Hui Chen, Li Huang, Roger Guzman, Qi Zheng, Senhao Lv, Jinan Shi, Haitao Yang, Wu Zhou, Hong-Jun Gao
- **Date**: 2025-09-14
- **Objective**: To uncover the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping the quantum states of the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$.
- **Finding**: The researchers uncovered intrinsic quantum clusters—localized intrinsic point defects identified as native oxygen defects—on the surface of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy, combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM/EELS). These oxygen impurities occupy specific hollow sites on the Sn-terminated surface, tuning the flat band near the Fermi level and exhibiting an unconventional Zeeman effect, while on the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials generate occupied impurity states with distinct symmetries and no measurable magnetic response, establishing them as tunable local perturbations in a topological kagome magnet.

**45. [Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726v1)**
- **Authors**: Mariana Palos, Liam Spillane, Geri Topore, Yaqi Li, David Pesquera, Colin Ophus, Stephanie M. Ribet, Michele Shelly Conroy
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster electron-beam trajectories on dose-sensitive techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography in scanning transmission electron microscopy.
- **Finding**: The study found that ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieved atomic resolution and remained robust to large jumps in probe position with non-raster trajectories (spiral and multi-pass sequential patterns). In contrast, atomic-resolution EELS maps showed pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Spiral scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO$_3$ thin films improved dose uniformity and mitigated drift-related distortions, establishing practical guidelines for programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM and highlighting ptychography's inherent resilience to trajectory-induced artifacts.

- **Authors**: Debarghya Mallick, Sujoy Ghosh, An Hsi Chen, Qiangsheng Lu, Liam Collins, Sangsoo Kim, Gyula Eres, Ivan Kravchenko, Stephen Jesse, Steven J. Randolph, Scott T. Retterer, Matthew Brahlek, Robert G. Moore
- **Date**: 2025-09-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate an all-in-plane method for fabricating superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak links by "nanosculpting" channels into thin films of FeTe$_{0.75}$Se$_{0.25}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ using a focused Si$^{++}$ ion beam (FIB).
- **Finding**: Systematic irradiation with FIB created controllable weak links by progressively suppressing both the critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical current ($I_c$). Kelvin probe force microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy corroborated the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region. $I_c(B)$ measurements revealed that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers, mitigating vortex motion. This establishes FIB patterning as a versatile platform for engineering robust, scalable fault-tolerant qubits by shifting from an SC-N-SC regime toward an SC-I-SC geometry.

- **Authors**: Jishnu Ghosh, Shubham Parate, Arup Basak, Binoy Krishna De, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyay, Abhinav Agarwal, Gopesh Kumar Gupta, Digbijoy Nath, Pavan Nukala
- **Date**: 2025-09-11
- **Objective**: To demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) in In$_2$Se$_3$ ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) and understand its underlying mechanism.
- **Finding**: The study observed gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in In$_2$Se$_3$ FeS-FETs. Combining high-resolution electron microscopy with electrical transport measurements, the NDR was attributed to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance alpha-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging revealed that in-plane electric fields drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments (generating Moire patterns), and intralayer shear, producing stress-induced phase transitions, while out-of-plane fields resulted in robust non-volatile polarization switching.

**48. [Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497v1)**
- **Authors**: Patrick Giese, Mathias Stokkebye Nissen, Stig Helveg, Jakob Schiøtz
- **Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Objective**: To study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS$_2$) nanoparticles and explain recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations.
- **Finding**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations revealed enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes as nanoparticle edges were approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations. Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explained this by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need for full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. The study also introduced a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials for accurate DFT extrapolations.

**49. [Comparing Machine Learning and Physics-Based Nanoparticle Geometry Determinations Using Far-Field Spectral Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08174v1)**
- **Authors**: Mengqi Sun, Zixu Huang, Muammer Y. Yaman, Maxim Ziatdinov, Sergei V. Kalinin, David S. Ginger
- **Date**: 2025-09-09
- **Objective**: To explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for determining the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) from far-field spectral properties, and compare its performance with physics-based analysis.
- **Finding**: The study successfully used a dual-branch multimodal VAE, trained on paired spectra-electron microscopy image data, to predict Au NR geometries (orientational angle and aspect ratio) using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra. The VAE's performance for orientational angle prediction was comparable to physics-based cos($2\theta$) fitting (MAE of 14.4 vs. 8.78), and similar for aspect ratio determination (MAE of 0.21 vs. 0.23). This demonstrates that by learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model can generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio from spectra-only input, suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems.

- **Date**: 2025-09-09
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the tunable synthesis of different crystal phases of CrS$_2$ (1T$'$ and 1T) and Cr$_2$S$_3$ via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterize their properties.
- **Finding**: The study successfully synthesized the distorted octahedral 1T$'$ CrS$_2$, a previously unreported crystal phase, and also 1T CrS$_2$. The phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction. The 1T$'$ CrS$_2$ crystals exhibited soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperatures. 4DSTEM characterization revealed that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation from 1T to 1T$'$, resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals, paving the way for scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories and spintronics.
