- **Authors**: Miran Joo, Huixin Xiu, Sabrina Baha, Ridha Zerdoumi, Ningyan Cheng, Christoph Somsen, Yujiao Li, Aleksander Kostka, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Alfred Ludwig, Christina Scheu
- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To examine the impact of Ru concentration on the electrocatalytic performance and microstructural defects of $Au-Pd-Pt-Ru$ complex solid solution thin films.
- **Finding**: Increasing Ru content was found to improve hydrogen evolution reaction activity and trigger a transition from nanotwins to high-density stacking faults.
