- **Authors**: Akira Miura, Woohyeon Baek, Yuta Fujii, Kiyoharu Tadanaga, Rana Hossain, Aichi Yamashita, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Chikako Moriyoshi, Shintaro Kobayashi, Shogo Kawaguchi, Jiong Ding, Shigeo Mori, Atsushi Sakuda, Akitoshi Hayashi, Wenhao Sun
- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: Rationalize the synthesizability and anomalous stability of metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_{3}\text{PS}_{4}$ by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: The $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. *In-situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and **electron microscopy** directly visualized the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation, resolving the thermodynamic paradox.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: Achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity in epitaxial nickelate thin films with a transition temperature ($T_{c}$) exceeding the previously established limit of $\sim 40\text{ K}$.

**8. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: Evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements in 2D materials using differential phase contrast (DPC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive simulations showed that defocus significantly underestimates the electrostatic field magnitude (e.g., up to $30\%$ for a $30\text{ mrad}$ probe). Two-fold astigmatism introduces orientation-dependent variations exceeding $40\%$ for magnitudes below $3\text{ nm}$. The analysis confirms the sensitivity of the scattergram-based method and underscores the necessity of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate CoM based **STEM** imaging.

**9. [Microscopic evidence of dominant excitonic instability in $\text{Ta}_{2}\text{NiSe}_{5}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03011v1)**
- **Authors**: Seokjin Bae, Arjun Raghavan, Irena Feldman, Amit Kanigel, Vidya Madhavan
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: Present microscopic evidence supporting the excitonic origin of the insulating phase in $\text{Ta}_{2}\text{NiSe}_{5}$, distinguishing it from the accompanying structural distortion.
- **Finding**: **Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS)** revealed that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk distortion is absent, suggesting the structural distortion is not the primary cause of the insulating state. The decay length of in-gap states at localized charge puddles matches the estimated exciton wavefunction size, providing strong evidence that $\text{Ta}_{2}\text{NiSe}_{5}$ is an intrinsic excitonic insulator.

- **Authors**: Yanyan Geng, Manyu Wang, Shumin Meng, Shuo Mi, Chang Li, Huiji Hu, Jianfeng Guo, Rui Xu, Fei Pang, Wei Ji, Weichang Zhou, Zhihai Cheng
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: Realize and characterize vertical/lateral polytype heterostructures (T-H) in a hole-doped Mott insulator via thermal-annealing-induced structural transitions.
- **Finding**: The coexistence of T-H polytype heterostructures was confirmed. **Atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS)** measurements revealed a "transparent effect" in $1\text{H}/1\text{T}$ vertical heterostructures, where the charge density wave (CDW) of the underlying $1\text{T}$-layer superposes on the top $1\text{H}$-layer. The metallic $1\text{H}$-layer was shown to impose a Coulomb screening effect on the $1\text{T}$-layer, suppressing CDW domain walls and forming more ordered electronic states.

- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: Establish micro-Raman spectroscopy of optical moiré phonons as a rapid, non-invasive probe for precise determination and mapping of local twist angle variations in twisted $\text{WSe}_{2}$ bilayers.
- **Finding**: A combined lateral force microscopy (LFM) and micro-Raman approach uncovered lateral twist angle variations exceeding $1^{\circ}$ across micrometer scales. Distinct Raman modes from optical moiré phonons in the $3^{\circ} < \alpha < 12^{\circ}$ range allow twist angle determination with a precision better than $\pm 0.3^{\circ}$ and sub-micrometer spatial resolution, applicable even to fully $\text{hBN}$-encapsulated heterostructures.

- **Authors**: Claire Wu, Mythili Surendran, Shin Muramoto, Alexander Grutter, Jayakanth Ravichandran
- **Date**: 2025-12-01
- **Objective**: Investigate the mechanisms governing unintentional carbon (C) incorporation and its impact on film growth and properties in transition metal chalcogenide thin films grown by hybrid pulsed laser deposition (hPLD).
- **Finding**: Optimal growth temperatures were identified for $\text{ZnS}$ ($400^{\circ}\text{C}$), $\text{TiS}_{2}$ ($500^{\circ}\text{C}$), and $\text{BaTiS}_{3}$ ($700^{\circ}\text{C}$), above or below which C incorporation increased, correlating with degraded texture. For $\text{TiS}_{2}$, high TBDS pressure led to loss of preferential texture, likely due to C graphitization poisoning the interface. **Atomic force microscopy (AFM)** was used, alongside XRD, to characterize film morphology and texture degradation due to C incorporation.

- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: Investigate how a CsCl seed layer improves the growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskites on textured silicon bottom cells to enhance the efficiency of monolithic tandem solar cells.
- **Finding**: The CsCl seed layer promotes organic precursor incorporation, even in areas with thin hole-transporting material layers, preventing the formation of interfacial $\text{PbI}_{2}$ and leading to larger apparent grains. This homogenization resulted in a high-efficiency perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell (certified efficiency of $29.7\%$).

- **Objective**: Investigate the ferroelectric microstructures and dynamic behavior of chemically ordered ferroelectric $\text{Pb}(\text{Sc}_{1/2}\text{Nb}_{1/2})\text{O}_{3}$ ($\text{PSN}$).
- **Finding**: Intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains were discovered, indicating that electric polarization can fluctuate around the $[111]$ direction despite the formation of long-range ordered rhombohedral domains, leading to unique weak relaxor properties. **In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** with dark-field imaging successfully revealed the dynamic behavior of domain-wall movements and the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence near the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition.

- **Objective**: Develop a scalable thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy for synthesizing uniform, large-area $\text{WS}_{2}$ thin films by sulfurizing tungsten precursors and demonstrate their application in Schottky-barrier solar cells.
- **Finding**: Optimal growth occurred at $800^{\circ}\text{C}$, yielding high-crystallinity $\text{WS}_{2}$ films. Films grown on sputtered W thin films showed significantly enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness compared to W foils. Schottky-barrier solar cells based on transferred $\text{WS}_{2}$ achieved a power conversion efficiency of $1.45\%$. **Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM),** and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** were used to validate the creation of stoichiometric, layered $\text{WS}_{2}$ and characterize film morphology.

- **Authors**: Muxian Xu, Siyu Cheng, Andrea Capa Salinas, Ganesh Pokharel, Alexander LaFleur, Hong Li, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Qinwen Deng, Binghai Yan, Ziqiang Wang, Stephen D. Wilson, Ilija Zeljkovic
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: Investigate the relationship between electronic nematicity (rotational symmetry breaking) and the $2 \times 2$ charge density wave (CDW) phase in the prototypical kagome superconductor $\text{CsV}_{3}\text{Sb}_{5}$.
- **Finding**: Using chemical doping to suppress the CDW phase, **spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)** revealed that electronic rotational symmetry breaking persists in short-range nanoscale regions across a wide doping range, even after the CDW is suppressed. This demonstrates that electronic nematicity is the ubiquitous, intrinsic parent state of kagome superconductors, independent of the $2 \times 2$ CDW.

- **Date**: 2025-11-25
- **Objective**: Achieve direct, real-space imaging of moiré-confined excitons within the moiré unit cell of twisted bilayer $\text{MoS}_{2}$ with nanometer resolution.
- **Finding**: Room-temperature **photocurrent atomic force microscopy (AFM)** successfully imaged excitons across the moiré of a $2^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer $\text{MoS}_{2}$. The measurements directly resolved site-selective confinement, showing that direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries, confirming predictions from a Wannier-based moiré-exciton model.

- **Finding**: High-resolution **scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)** on atomically flat exfoliated flakes of $(\text{Bi}_{0.1}\text{Sb}_{0.9})_{2}\text{Te}_{3}$ revealed QWS driven by quantum confinement. The standard phase accumulation model accurately captured QWS characteristics. Spatially resolved spectroscopy confirmed that QWS of Dirac electrons remain robust against defect scattering, paving the way for surface-state engineering.

**21. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: Introduce and characterize "e-coherent" crystalline interfaces, where local non-affine transformations enhance coherency by introducing arrays of line defects termed discohesions.
- **Finding**: E-coherency results from non-affine relaxations that insert disconnection dipoles or loops (discohesions), leading to additional coincidence sites. Atomistic simulations and **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** demonstrated that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are fundamentally different from non-e-coherent interfaces, suggesting e-coherency is likely pervasive in crystalline solids.

- **Finding**: By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent **electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)** in **STEM**, the methodology directly visualizes orbital occupation at individual atomic columns. Using strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_{3}$, the $\text{Mn}-3d$ $e_{g}$ orbital polarization was resolved with sub-angstrom precision, confirming that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^{2}-r^{2}$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^{2}-y^{2}$.

- **Objective**: Demonstrate and characterize a tungsten (W) doping-induced structural phase transition between semiconducting polytypes in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown bilayer ($\text{2L}$) $\text{MoS}_{2}$.
- **Finding**: Increasing W concentration induces a phase transition from non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to centrosymmetric $\text{AB}'$ stacking, evidenced by the vanishing second harmonic generation (SHG) signal and stiffening of the layer-breathing vibrational mode. **Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM)** demonstrated the spatial distribution of W concentration and confirmed the associated structural changes, validating W-doping as an effective strategy for polytype engineering.

- **Finding**: $\text{GaGeTe}$ exhibits high plasticity, breaking the inherent brittleness of traditional binary germanium-based chalcogenides. Spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealed a novel deformation mechanism co-dominated by intralayer lattice distortion and interlayer slip, providing fresh insight into the critical role of intralayer structural evolution in plastic behavior.

- **Objective**: Integrate operando synchrotron X-ray techniques with high-resolution cryogenic microscopy to mechanistically understand phase transformations and interfacial chemistry in Pt-based alloying anodes during electrochemical cycling.
- **Finding**: Direct observation confirmed the initial lithiation-driven formation of $\text{Li}_{2}\text{Pt}$ and its evolution to a stable LiPt intermetallic phase via a solid solution reaction mechanism. Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) transitioned to a stable $\text{LiF}$-dominated composition. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography (APT) revealed nanoscale compositional gradients, including lithium flux limited zones and a homogeneous LiPt bulk, which rationalizes the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism.
