**1. [Role of defects in the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases at asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16611v1)
- **Authors**: Swetha Pemma, Lena Langenohl, Saba Saood, Yoonji Choi, Rebecca Janisch, Christian H. Liebscher, Gerhard Dehm, Tobias Brink
- **Date**: 2026-01-23
- **Objective**: To understand how geometrically necessary defects (disconnections) influence the thermodynamic stability and phase transitions of grain boundary phases at general, asymmetric tilt boundaries in copper.
- **Finding**: Defect energies, specifically those related to disconnections (dislocation-like line defects), have a major influence on the stability of grain boundary phases, even at small inclinations. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) experiments were used to analyze these disconnections in experimental $\text{Cu}$ and $\text{Al}$ samples, demonstrating competition between defective asymmetric grain boundary phases and grain boundary faceting at large inclinations.

- **Authors**: Alyssa Ang De Guzman, Anish Mathai Varghese, Saif Alshalloudi, Lance Kosca, Kyriaki Polychronopoulou, Marko Gacesa
- **Date**: 2026-01-21
- **Objective**: To validate and characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants representative of the lunar highlands and south pole to assess their suitability for in situ oxygen production.

Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) provided crucial data on the mineralogical heterogeneity and compositional fidelity, supporting the conclusion that oxygen extraction is governed by the whole-regolith response rather than ilmenite content alone.

Electron microscopy equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) provided crucial high-throughput structural and compositional data, while Atom Probe Tomography (APT) revealed local compositional fluctuations at grain boundaries.

Correlative Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Transmission Electron Microscopy (TKD-TEM) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) provided near-atomic resolution data, confirming that $\text{Fe-Ni}$ atomic exchange between $\kappa$ and $\text{B}2$ is thermodynamically favorable, driving the B2 phase evolution and improving stability.

- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport evolution in ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ bilayers as a function of $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$), focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) revealed a percolation-driven structural transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ decreased below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This structural evolution correlated with a divergence in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) and a crossover in the AHE mechanism from mixed intrinsic/side-jump to skew-scattering dominant, underscoring the link between microstructure and Hall transport.

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To provide clear experimental evidence regarding the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ thin films, a candidate altermagnet, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
- **Finding**: The observed XLD signal in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ was nearly invariant with temperature and cooling field direction, in stark contrast to theoretical predictions for magnetic order, strongly suggesting a nonmagnetic origin for the material. (Note: While XLD is the primary technique, the finding addresses a fundamental structural/magnetic property dispute.)

**27. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\alpha$-Mn precipitate size in an ultrafine-grained Mg-Mn alloy during room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT).
- **Finding**: The volume fraction of nm-scale $\alpha$-Mn precipitates increased with applied strain, but analysis using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that the mean particle size did not increase. This finding, combined with the precipitate size distribution, suggests that precipitate growth during HPT is subject to interfacial control rather than diffusional control.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analysis of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) in Nb and $\mathrm{Ta}$-encapsulated $\mathrm{Nb}$ thin films relevant to superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Atom-probe tomography (APT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed oxygen segregation at GBs in both film types, with segregation levels correlating positively with bulk oxygen concentration. The enrichment factor $C_{\mathrm{gb}}/C_{\mathrm{grain}}$ for oxygen in Nb was $2.7 \pm 0.3$, slightly reduced in Ta-capped films ($2.3 \pm 0.3$). Increased oxygen concentration in grains and GBs was correlated with a suppression of the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), providing atomic-scale insight into decoherence mechanisms.

- **Objective**: To directly probe the onset and dynamics of strain formation during a laser-excited insulator-metal phase transition in $\mathrm{VO}_2$ using ultrafast four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM).
- **Finding**: Ultrafast 4D STEM enabled virtual imaging and strain mapping at every point in space and time, directly visualizing the spatiotemporal propagation of the phase transition on picosecond timescales. This correlative capability showed how atomic-scale symmetry breaking inherently generates lattice distortions that propagate to govern macroscopic property changes.

- **Authors**: Lauren J. Riddiford, Anne Flechsig, Shilei Ding, Emir Karadza, Niklas Kercher, Tobias Goldenberger, Elisabeth Müller, Pietro Gambardella, Laura J. Heyderman, Aleš Hrabec
- **Date**: 2026-01-04
- **Objective**: To generate unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) by creating controlled phase gradients in tungsten (W) thin films using direct-write laser annealing.
- **Finding**: Laser annealing induces a continuous transformation from the high-resistivity $\beta$-W phase (high SOT efficiency) to the low-resistivity $\alpha$-W phase (low SOT efficiency). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to track this continuous crystalline phase transformation, demonstrating that sufficiently steep phase gradients allow for field-free magnetization switching in $\mathrm{CoFeB}/\mathrm{W}$ devices.
