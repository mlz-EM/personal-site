- **Authors**: M. G. Masteghin, Z. P. Aslam, A. P. Brown, M. J. Whiting, S. K. Clowes, R. P. Webb, D. C. Cox
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To quantify the full damage profile, including the low-dose tail, of focused ion beams (FIBs) using 4D-STEM precession electron diffraction and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics.
- **Finding**: The study utilizes four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<0.1$ ions nm$^{-2}$, which is often overlooked by conventional techniques. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns, acquired around static dwell spots exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam, were compared to calibration regions. Cross-correlation using PSNR revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artifacts than conventional dark-field imaging, providing a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes.

- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To examine the nanoindentation hardness and deformation behavior of amorphous-amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ nanolaminates with varying bilayer thicknesses.
- **Finding**: The study found that hardness decreases with reduced bilayer thickness in amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ nanolaminates, contrasting with crystalline systems. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that fine bilayer spacings promote closely spaced vertical shear bands with bilayer compression, while coarser spacings show fewer, widely spaced shear bands with chemical intermixing. Scanning electron diffraction mapping further demonstrated significant densification beneath indents, indicating that high interface density facilitates strain accommodation and prevents catastrophic failure typical of brittle amorphous materials.

- **Finding**: The researchers successfully synthesized perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with average sizes up to 100 nm using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation, without additional liquid media or stabilizing ligands. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction confirmed the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX$_3$ forming larger (approximately 90 nm) cubic NCs and Cs$_2$AgBiX$_6$ forming smaller (approximately 10 nm) rounded NCs. This method offers a clean, scalable, and versatile route to high-purity, ligand-free perovskite NCs with tunable optical properties.

- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Objective**: To demonstrate how four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in the structural analysis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), including chirality determination, strain mapping, and atomic defect imaging.
- **Finding**: Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, 4D-STEM enabled rapid acquisition of low-noise electron diffraction patterns from SWCNTs, allowing precise local chirality determination of multiple nanotubes with limited electron dose (down to 1750 e$^{-}/$\AA$^2$) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). This approach also tracked chirality along single nanotubes and provided access to strain distribution. Furthermore, 4D-STEM data facilitated high-resolution image reconstruction with electron ptychography, achieving atomic-scale spatial resolution for imaging atomic defects, with multi-slice electron ptychography offering potential for close to 3D imaging of defect structures.

**11. [Optimizing probes for multi-beam ptychography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24542v1)**
- **Authors**: Runqing Yang, Pablo Villanueva-Perez, Maik Kahnt
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: To establish a quantitative framework for assessing and optimizing probe sets for multi-beam ptychography (MBP) based on separability, uniformity, and fabrication feasibility, aiming to improve reconstruction robustness and scalability.
- **Finding**: The study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate probe sets for MBP. It demonstrated that Hadamard-based binary phase masks consistently outperform other probe designs (Zernike polynomials, experimentally feasible phase plates, and spiral phase masks) across varying scan densities, leading to more robust MBP reconstructions. While spiral masks offered comparable resolution, their increased structural complexity limited efficient scaling. This work provides practical criteria for designing structured probes to enable more robust and scalable MBP in high-throughput coherent X-ray and EUV imaging.

- **Authors**: Hitoshi Makino, Bernd Rellinghaus, Sebastian Schneider, Axel Lubk, Darius Pohl
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Objective**: To present a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) measurements in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), addressing its fundamental limitation by noise.
- **Finding**: The study developed a methodology for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD, demonstrated on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was systematically analyzed using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure minimized systematic errors, and variance-to-mean analysis revealed detector-amplified shot noise as the dominant noise source. This work recommends stricter SNR thresholds for reliable EMCD detection and quantification, advancing its reliability as a quantitative tool for nanoscale magnetic characterization.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate a new approach for lensless 3D imaging of non-periodic specimens using X-ray fluorescence intensity correlations, eliminating the need for extensive sample rotations required by coherent diffraction imaging.
- **Finding**: The study shows that intensity correlations of X-ray fluorescence, excited by ultrashort X-ray pulses, contain 3D structural information of non-periodic, stationary objects. By illuminating a vanadium foil with a sub-200 nm X-ray laser beam and recording 16 distinct specimen projections from different detector regions without sample rotation, they confirmed that FEL-induced fluorescence reflects real-space structural changes. This establishes a novel lensless 3D imaging method, offering element-specific nanoscale insights beyond conventional light and electron microscopy.

- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Objective**: To characterize the morphology of buried interfaces in twisted oxide moirés, highlighting interface roughness as a critical challenge for atomic-level coupling and demonstrating the superior capability of electron ptychography for resolving structural variations.
- **Finding**: The study reveals that topographic mismatch due to surface roughness critically restricts atomic-scale proximity at interfaces in twisted oxide moirés, even after eliminating contaminants. While conventional through-focal imaging is relatively insensitive to buried interfaces, electron ptychography reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer. Cross-sectional imaging is emphasized as essential for characterizing interface morphology, corroborating investigations of interlayer coupling, and highlighting the need for advanced characterization methods in oxide twistronics.

**15. [Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21320v1)**
- **Authors**: Tim Titze, Sabri Koraltan, Timo Schmidt, Mailin Matthies, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Dieter Suess, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil
- **Date**: 2025-10-24
- **Objective**: To investigate and control the order and dynamics of bubble and skyrmion lattices in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers through stripe domain engineering using in-plane magnetic fields.
- **Finding**: The study shows that applying a brief in-plane "set" magnetic field to the stripe state in Fe/Gd multilayers enhances both the frequency and amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM), magnetic force microscopy (MFM), and micromagnetic simulations revealed that this enhancement stems from field-aligned stripes nucleating a dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice (with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice) upon subsequent out-of-plane field application. This demonstrates precise control over coherent magnetization dynamics and potentially topology by modifying the initial domain configuration.

Its object-oriented, modular design makes it highly extendable for prototyping new imaging models and integrating machine learning. The package demonstrated its accuracy, versatility, and extensibility through challenging case studies involving limited coherence, low overlap, and unstable illumination, advancing computational ptychography.

- **Finding**: The study developed a boron nitride (BN) coating for CR-39 detectors, which converts neutrons into energetic alpha particles via the $^{10}$B(n,$\alpha$)$^{7}$Li reaction, thereby enhancing neutron detection efficiency. Partially coated CR-39 pieces exposed to AmBe, $^{252}$Cf, and D-T (14 MeV) neutron sources were subsequently analyzed using optical microscopy and large-area scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. The results showed that the BN coating significantly improved the detection efficiency (tracks per neutron) for all tested sources, providing a comprehensive guide for neutron detection with CR-39.

- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) analysis in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for sub-10 nm quantification of spin and orbital magnetic moments, using the metamagnetic phase transition in FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that EMCD in TEM can quantitatively measure spin and orbital magnetic moments with element and atomic site sensitivity. The extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remained consistent with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$ was observed, attributed to instrumental factors and nanoscale heterogeneity. This confirms EMCD's quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments.

**19. [Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517v2)**
- **Authors**: M. J. Adriaans, J. P. Hoogenboom, A. Mohammadi-Gheidari
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Objective**: To analyze the design considerations for electrostatic electron monochromators, demonstrating the limitations of current designs and proposing a cost-effective, simpler design based on pure fringe fields.
- **Finding**: The study showed that current monochromators, based on homogeneous-field deflectors, are extremely sensitive to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections, necessitating complex correcting elements. It demonstrated that a fringe-field deflector is less sensitive to these issues. A new, fully electrostatic monochromator design is proposed, utilizing pure fringe fields and momentary deceleration lenses, which does not need extra correcting elements. This design, potentially realizable with MEMS technology, offers a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering electron beam energies, enhancing spatial and energy resolution in electron microscopy.

- **Objective**: To develop a novel approach for predicting the 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes from readily available 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, overcoming the limitations of costly 3D acquisition methods.
- **Finding**: The study proposes a method that uses a low-parametric 3D stochastic geometry model to generate virtual 3D microstructures, coupled with a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain corresponding 2D images. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a large dataset generated by systematically varying model parameters, the 3D microstructure can be statistically reconstructed from 2D SEM images. An error analysis on key geometrical descriptors quantitatively evaluated the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool, offering a more accessible way to characterize SOFC anodes.

These ZDSDs promote slip diversity and intense work hardening, leading to a three-fold enhancement in both strength and ductility in Ti-0.45O compared to conventional pure Ti. The advanced electron microscopy technique was crucial for quantitatively modeling these atomic-scale defects and linking them to enhanced mechanical properties.

X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and Raman spectroscopy confirmed this precise thickness control. For the first time, the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$ (space group R-3) was stabilized, and its functional properties were compared with density functional theory calculations, opening pathways for tailoring complex oxide properties.
