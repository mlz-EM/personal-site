- **Authors**: Yongsen Zhang, Wei Liu, Meng Shi, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Sheng Qiu, Huanhuan Zhang, Hui Han, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Shouguo Wang, Jin Tang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To directly image and characterize the emergent properties of ultrasmall nanometric skyrmion lattices in real space using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM).
- **Finding**: LTEM in Fresnel mode revealed an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon in $\text{Mn}_{0.5}\text{Fe}_{0.5}\text{Ge}$ skyrmion lattices when analyzed by conventional methods. Systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations established that this chiral misinterpretation is due to the contrast transfer function's sinusoidal modulation mechanism, which quantitatively limits the conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall skyrmions.

**31. [Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285v1)**
- **Authors**: BoCheng Yu, JiaLiang Jiang, Jing Meng, XiaoYan Zhu, Jie Ma, HaiFeng Du, QingFeng Zhan, Jin Tang, Yang Xu, Tian Shang
- **Date**: 2025-12-11
- **Objective**: To determine the true origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies observed in Zn-doped $\text{Mn}_2\text{Sb}$ ferrimagnet, distinguishing between a topological Hall effect and trivial mechanisms.

- **Authors**: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
- **Date**: 2025-12-09
- **Objective**: To investigate and quantify the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance of neural network segmentation models used for High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) imaging.
- **Finding**: Using synthetic data generated via multislice simulation, the study demonstrated that neural network segmentation models exhibit significant performance stability. A framework utilizing the **HRTEM contrast transfer function (CTF)** was developed to compare information content and quantify OOD domain shifts, showing that performance smoothly and predictably degrades as imaging conditions deviate from the training distribution.

**35. [Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B Alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07285v1)**
- **Authors**: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To explore the critical influence of lattice distortion on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of $(\text{Nd}_{1-x}\text{Pr}_x)_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ permanent magnets.
- **Finding**: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis of $\text{Nd}_2\text{Fe}_{14}\text{B}$ alloys revealed substantial compressive strain, up to 25%, localized near grain boundaries. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that while $K_{\rm u}$ is $4.2$ $\text{MJ}/\text{m}^3$ under strain-free conditions, this $25\%$ compressive strain causes $K_{\rm u}$ to become negative, demonstrating that lattice distortions observed by STEM critically govern the magnetic properties.

- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Objective**: To provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) hosts photoluminescent color centers.
- **Finding**: A new defect, RU1, was identified in meteoritic lonsdaleite grains, exhibiting bright and stable emission (peak $\sim 700$ nm) with a $14$ ns excited-state lifetime. Correlative electron microscopy was essential in confirming the lonsdaleite host lattice structure, suggesting that hexagonal-diamond color centers may form a new family of solid-state quantum emitters.

**37. [Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06481v1)**
- **Authors**: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To observe and understand the spatial evolution of strain-induced spin rearrangement, specifically helical domain reorientation, under uniaxial tensile stress.
- **Finding**: *In situ* Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) allowed direct manipulation and observation of helical domain reorientation. The findings revealed that magnetic defects mediate the reorientation via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes, demonstrating a striking similarity to plastic deformation in metals and advancing strain-driven magnetic control.

**38. [Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465v1)**
- **Authors**: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
- **Date**: 2025-12-06
- **Objective**: To systematically study the emergence and control of Surface Spirals (SS) at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI) using the phase factor $\phi_0$ as a control parameter.
- **Finding**: Micromagnetic simulations predicted that SSs form adjacent to FCIs, with their shape and topological charge controlled by the cone's in-plane reorientation. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) observations in $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{10}\text{Mn}_2$ thin films confirmed that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, demonstrating two distinct formation pathways (thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation).

- **Date**: 2025-12-05
- **Objective**: To resolve the thermodynamic paradox regarding the synthesizability and anomalous stability of the metastable $\alpha$-$\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ solid-state electrolyte by establishing a comprehensive Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram.
- **Finding**: Computational and experimental data showed that the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized at the nanoscale due to low surface energy, drastically lowering the nucleation barrier. This size-dependent stabilization mechanism was directly visualized using *in situ* synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase particles.

- **Authors**: Guangdi Zhou, Heng Wang, Haoliang Huang, Yaqi Chen, Fei Peng, Wei Lv, Zihao Nie, Wei Wang, Qi-Kun Xue, Zhuoyu Chen
- **Date**: 2025-12-04
- **Objective**: To achieve and characterize ambient-pressure superconductivity with an onset transition temperature ($T_c$) above $60$ K in epitaxial nickelate thin films.
- **Finding**: Epitaxial $(\text{La},\text{Pr})_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ thin films grown under compressive strain exhibited a superconductivity onset at $\sim 63$ K. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the large-scale crystalline purity of these films, which is crucial for stabilizing the inherently metastable strained phase and linking the enhanced $T_c$ to strange-metal behavior ($\alpha \sim 1$).

- **Objective**: To develop a fast, self-supervised machine learning (ML) pipeline for denoising low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images suitable for *in situ* experiments.
- **Finding**: The pipeline, based on a blind-spot convolutional neural network, significantly outperformed other denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, improving the visual clarity of atomic features in HRTEM.

- **Authors**: Billy E. Yang, Saeed S. I. Almishal, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Mary Kathleen Caucci, Gerald Bejger, Christina M. Rost, Nasim Alem, Susan B. Sinnott, Jon-Paul Maria
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_2$-$\text{LA}_2\text{O}_3$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and resolve the stability regions of bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive characterization suite, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, was critical for quantifying crystal structure and identifying boundaries between closely related phases. The study demonstrated that quenched kinetic energy in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase with only $20\%$ Ce, which electroneutrality constraints require to have an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice ($\sim 16.7\%$).

- **Finding**: X-ray absorption spectroscopy identified that interfaces induce charge transfer, resulting in partial Co $d^7$ or $d^5$ occupancy, and that a $\text{LaAlO}_3$ spacer layer results in a Co $d^6$ low spin state. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed a clear connection between the strain induced at the oxide interface and the resulting Co spin configuration, demonstrating simultaneous control over orbital occupancy and spin state.

- **Authors**: Renata de Oliveira Melo, Jean-Bernard Vogt, Eric Nivet, Flore Villaret, Christophe Grosjean, Eric Baustert, Nhu-Cuong Tran, Jeremie Bouquerel, Gang Ji
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To establish quantitative correlations between microstructural evolution induced by aging heat treatments and the mechanical performance (tensile strength and impact toughness) of PBF-LB produced 17-4 PH stainless steel.
- **Finding**: Multiscale microstructural characterization using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) identified $\text{SiO}_2$ inclusions from the starting powder as detrimental nucleation sites for micro-cavities, leading to low impact toughness. TEM also characterized the distribution of Cu-rich nanoprecipitates, confirming that tailoring their distribution to enhance Orowan strengthening resulted in a pronounced strength-toughness trade-off.

**46. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic field measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC)-STEM.
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations for DPC-STEM confirmed that instrumental misalignment significantly affects measurement accuracy. For a $21$ mrad probe, a $4$ nm defocus can underestimate the electrostatic field magnitude by up to $16\%$. Two-fold astigmatism introduced orientation-dependent variations exceeding $40\%$ for magnitudes below $3$ nm, underscoring the necessity of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate Center of Mass (CoM) based STEM imaging.
