- **Finding**: **Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)** showed that head-to-head (HH) DWs contain a layer of nonpolar $\beta\text{-}\text{In}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$, while tail-to-tail (TT) DWs are atomically abrupt. **4D STEM** and **multislice electron ptychography** mapped complex, curved 3D domain structures. Band structure calculations revealed localized conducting states within a $\sim 1$ nm thick layer at both HH and TT DWs, making them candidates for 2D electron/hole gases.

- **Date**: 2026-01-17
- **Objective**: To study the electric charge transport and dielectric properties of Barium Titanate ($\text{BaTiO}_{3}$) ceramics synthesized by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) with varying carbon content.
- **Finding**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to estimate the concentration and distribution of carbon impurity within the samples. The ceramics exhibited colossal relative dielectric permittivity ($\sim 10^{5} - 10^{6}$), and the study showed that increased carbon concentration leads to decreased permittivity and resistivity, with conduction determined by the Mott variable range hopping mechanism.

**38. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To analyze the evolution of structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties in ultrathin $\text{Si/Fe}$ bilayers as the $\text{Fe}$ layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) is varied, focusing on the percolation threshold.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) revealed a percolation-driven microstructural transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure when $t_{\text{Fe}}$ decreased below $30 \text{ \AA}$. This HRTEM-confirmed microstructural evolution coincided with a divergence in magnetotransport properties and a crossover of the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism from mixed intrinsic/side-jump to skew-scattering dominant behavior.

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To provide clear evidence regarding the presence or absence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_{2}$ thin films, a proposed altermagnetic candidate, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
