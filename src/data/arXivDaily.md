- **Authors**: Todd Brintlinger, Yi Qi, Kamal H. Baloch, David Goldhaber-Gordon, John Cumings
- **Date**: 2007-08-10

**40. [Lost Data in Electron Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18217v2)**
- **Authors**: Nina M. Ivanova, Alexey S. Kashin, Valentine P. Ananikov
- **Date**: 2025-08-10
- **Objective**: To estimate the amount of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation that is subsequently lost or unused in peer-reviewed scientific publications.

The use of loose supports in the algorithm allowed high-quality image recovery without requiring precise knowledge of the scanning illumination size or position, overcoming a key limitation of traditional ptychography.

- **Authors**: Jacob Madsen, Timothy J. Pennycook, Toma Susi
- **Date**: 2020-10-14
- **Objective**: To review the motivation and methodology for using *ab initio* simulations, derived mainly from Density Functional Theory (DFT), to describe the electron scattering potential in TEM, moving beyond the independent atom model (IAM).
- **Finding**: The review argues that an *ab initio* description of the scattering potential, which accounts for valence bonding effects, is becoming increasingly necessary and viable for modern electron microscopy techniques like 4D-STEM combined with ptychography. Using DFT-derived potentials allows extraction of maximum information from electron scattering, providing additional insights missed by the fast but approximate IAM.

**48. [Nanocartography: Planning for success in analytical electron microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03956v1)**
- **Authors**: Matthew Olszta, Kevin Fiedler
- **Date**: 2022-05-08

This methodology significantly reduces analysis time, allows microscopists to solve complex crystallographic unknowns at extremely small scales, and facilitates collaboration by enabling the conversion of sample orientation relationships across different microscopes.

- **Authors**: David Lamprecht, Anna Benzer, Manuel Längle, Mate Capin, Clemens Mangler, Toma Susi, Lado Filipovic, Jani Kotakoski
- **Date**: 2025-02-17
