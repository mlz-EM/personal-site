- **Authors**: Seokjo Hong, Jaewhan Oh, Woohyun Cho, Soyoung Lee, Colin Ophus, Yeongkwan Kim, Heejun Yang, SungBin Lee, Yongsoo Yang
- **Date**: 2025-06-03
- **Objective**: To probe the spatial correlations of charge density wave (CDW) order across the transition temperature in 2H-NbSe$_2$ using cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM).
