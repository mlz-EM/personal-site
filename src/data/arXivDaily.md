- **Authors**: Jiawei Huang, Jinyang Li, Xinyue Guo, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz, Zhen Chen, Zuhuang Chen, Shi Liu
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: Resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced experimental techniques and large-scale simulations.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations revealed that previously observed broad transitional regions in AlScN during polarization switching are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of $180^\circ$ domain walls. Simulations confirmed that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, consistent with nucleation-limited switching, and increasing Sc content systematically lowers domain wall energy and the associated nucleation barrier, reducing the switching field.

**11. [Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17085v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: Investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations in the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand its underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that Shockley partial dislocations ($a/6<112>$) cross-slip from one $\{111\}$ plane to another conjugate $\{111\}$ plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase of a CoNi-based superalloy. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies, while local stress concentrations also played a critical role, ultimately enhancing the alloy's high-temperature deformation resistance.

- **Objective**: Demonstrate that core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of small concentrations of dopants in known crystal structures.
- **Finding**: Through simulation, it was shown that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can effectively determine dopant site occupancy by leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy. The study highlights that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors, providing a robust method for characterizing dopant distribution in materials.

- **Finding**: The study proposes a more detailed physical abstraction for the incident beam in SE imaging, showing that the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture, not just a convolution of the mean. This improved modeling, particularly with time-resolved measurements (TRM), enabled a 5-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) for edge localization in Monte Carlo simulations compared to conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor was 5.4, demonstrating a significant improvement in resolution and feature localization for techniques like SEM and HIM.

- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: To determine the intrinsic magnetic properties, specifically anisotropy, at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ magnets using first-principles calculations, informed by experimental high-resolution electron microscopy images.

- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry on the structural and electronic properties, and ultimately superconductivity, in bilayer nickelates La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.
