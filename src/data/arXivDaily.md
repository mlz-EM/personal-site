-   **Authors**: Desheng Ma, Guanxing Li, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann
-   **Date**: 2025-07-28
-   **Objective**: Revisit H. Rose's generalized contrast formalism to understand where information is encoded in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data and identify new imaging modes that can serve as approximations to ptychography.
-   **Finding**: This theoretical work, focused on 4D-STEM, demonstrates that tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) imaging modes enable aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that maximizes information use under the weak phase object approximation. It identifies contrast transfer from inelastic/plural scattering electrons and shows how a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) can sum incoherent scattering components for depth sectioning. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography.

-   **Authors**: Timothy Wilson, Owen J. L. Rackham, Hendrik Ulbricht
-   **Date**: 2025-07-23

-   **Objective**: Demonstrate ferrochirality in tetragonal tungsten bronzes (K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$) and investigate the origin of their chirality and its coupling to external fields.
-   **Finding**: High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to solve the incommensurately modulated and chiral structures of K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$. TEM provided crucial insights into the local structural details, revealing that the chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms perpendicular to the c direction, which acts as the primary order parameter. The study proposes electric-strain-field coupling as a conjugate field for switching chirality, establishing these materials as a versatile playground for ferrochirality.

**49. [Mechanistic Insights into Nonthermal Ablation of Copper Nanoparticles under Femtosecond Laser Irradiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17100v1)**
-   **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
-   **Date**: 2025-07-23
-   **Objective**: Investigate the mechanisms of undesired ablation (fragmentation and coalescence) in copper (Cu) nanoparticles subjected to femtosecond (fs) laser scanning under sintering-relevant fluence conditions.
-   **Finding**: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to extract particle size distributions, revealing a bimodal transformation (emergence of sub-60 nm debris and formation of large aggregates up to 750 nm) after fs laser irradiation. Analysis, supported by SEM observations, identified hot electron blast as the dominant nonthermal ablation pathway (electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and blast pressures above 4 GPa), rather than Coulomb explosion. This work highlights that reducing hot electron temperature can effectively suppress ablation and expand the sintering window for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing.

-   **Date**: 2025-07-22
-   **Objective**: Investigate the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment during electrochemical cycling, using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
-   **Finding**: Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed the microstructural evolution of silicon anodes during lithiation/delithiation, with a controlled workflow preventing ambient exposure and cryo-TEM ensuring structural integrity. After the first lithiation, the electrode showed a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li$_{15}$Si$_4$, various amorphous Li$_x$Si phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure became predominantly amorphous with thread-like features. Cryo-STEM was essential for directly observing the transition from a crystalline phase to a more uniform amorphous microstructure after several cycles, providing insights for optimizing electrode architecture.
