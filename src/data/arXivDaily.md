- **Date**: 2026-01-20
- **Objective**: To achieve continuous control over the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors by modulating the Ni $3d$ orbital electron occupancy using an *operando* monitored reduction (OMR) method.
- **Finding**: The OMR method enables ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the Ni $3d$ occupancy (from $\sim 3d^7$ to $\sim 3d^9$).

**33. [Discovery of Ferroelectric Twin Boundaries in a Photoactive Halide Perovskite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12892v1)**
- **Authors**: Weilun Li, Qimu Yuan, Michael B. Johnston, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2026-01-19
- **Objective**: To investigate whether ferroelectric behavior exists in the photoactive halide perovskite $\text{CsPbI}_3$, particularly at ferroelastic twin boundaries.
- **Finding**: Low-dose Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) revealed the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries (parallel to $\{110\}$ and $\{112\}$) in vapor-deposited $\text{CsPbI}_3$ thin films. Crucially, STEM directly observed that $\text{Pb}$ atoms shift at the $\{110\}$ twin boundaries, inducing a local ferroelectric-like polarization, creating an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces within the bulk non-polar lattice.

- **Authors**: Soumi Mondal, Sreekant Anil, Saurav Islam, Yingdong Guan, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Aaron Pearre, Sandra Santhosh, Nasim Alem, Nitin Samarth, Zhiqiang Mao
- **Date**: 2026-01-18
- **Objective**: To synthesize high-quality $\alpha$-$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ single crystals with minimized carrier density by suppressing Se vacancies using a Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique.
- **Finding**: The modified Bridgman technique, utilizing a high-pressure, Se-rich environment, successfully produced pure $\alpha$-$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ single crystals with $3R$ stacking. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the structure and composition. The resulting crystals exhibited the lowest reported carrier density to date ($1.5-3.2 \times 10^{16}$ $\text{cm}^{-3}$), indicating a significant reduction in intrinsic Se-vacancies essential for ferroelectric studies.

- **Date**: 2026-01-17
- **Objective**: To investigate the electric charge transport and colossal dielectric properties of $\text{BaTiO}_3$ ceramics synthesized by Spark-Plasma Sintering (SPS) as a function of carbon impurity content.
- **Finding**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to estimate the concentration and distribution of carbon impurities. Conduction is determined by the Mott variable range hopping mechanism. The relative dielectric permittivity is colossal ($10^5 - 10^6$). Higher carbon concentration correlates with lower permittivity and resistivity in the Mott conduction range, supporting the validity of the Heywang model for describing the conduction mechanisms in these SPS ceramics.

**38. [Noise2Void for Denoising Atomic Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07699v1)**
- **Authors**: William Thornley, Sam Sullivan-Allsop, Rongsheng Cai, Nick Clark, Roman Gorbachev, Sarah J. Haigh
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To demonstrate the successful application of the Noise2Void deep learning technique for denoising atomic-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images and videos.

- **Authors**: Hao-Jin Wang, Liqun Shen, Xin-Ning Tian, Lei Lei, Kexin Wang, Grigore Moldovan, Marc-Georg Willinger, Zhu-Jun Wang
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To develop a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that couples a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning to achieve quantitative 4D (3D real space plus time) nanometrology.
- **Finding**: By employing a Vision Field Transformer as a differentiable surrogate for physical simulations, the framework enables single-shot, quantitative three-dimensional topography reconstruction from 2D Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) projections with high precision and throughput. This synergy allowed for 4D *in situ* characterization, tracking dynamic surface evolution during copper redox and revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics previously invisible to conventional imaging.

**40. [Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115v1)**
- **Authors**: S. S. Das, M. Senthil Kumar
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Objective**: To understand the connection between microstructural evolution near the percolation threshold and the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in ultrathin $\text{Si}/\text{Fe}$ bilayers.
- **Finding**: High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to a percolative network structure of grains when the Fe layer thickness ($t_{\text{Fe}}$) decreased below $30$ $\text{\AA}$. This structural evolution coincided with a crossover in the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) mechanism: from mixed intrinsic/side-jump ($n \sim 1.42$) in thick films to skew-scattering dominant ($n = 0.62$) in high-resistive, percolative films ($t_{\text{Fe}} \leq 30$ $\text{\AA}$).

- **Date**: 2026-01-11
- **Objective**: To definitively determine the existence of magnetic order in epitaxial $\text{RuO}_2$ thin films, a candidate for altermagnetism, using X-ray linear dichroism (XLD).
- **Finding**: XLD measurements, combined with photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and multiple scattering calculations, showed that the XLD signal in $\text{RuO}_2$ is nearly invariant with temperature and independent of the cooling field, directly contradicting the expected signal for magnetic order. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for $\text{RuO}_2$. Distinct XLD signals observed on different substrates were attributed to low-symmetry crystal field effects.

- **Date**: 2026-01-10
- **Objective**: To achieve the epitaxial stabilization of the metastable tantalum dioxide ($\text{TaO}_2$) thin films on $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ substrates using suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and thermal laser epitaxy (TLE).
- **Finding**: Successful single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained $\text{TaO}_2$ films was achieved. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) confirmed the microstructure, and Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed the tetravalent oxidation state of tantalum. The films exhibit a $0.3$ eV Mott gap. DFT calculations suggest the potential for a metal-insulator transition analogous to $\text{NbO}_2$.

- **Authors**: Alessia Fischetti, Giacometta Mineo, Daniela Russo, Francesco Salutari, Claudio Lentini Campallegio, Elena Bruno, Jordi Arbiol, Giorgia Franzò, Salvatore Mirabella, Vincenzina Strano, M. Chiara Spadaro
- **Date**: 2026-01-10
- **Objective**: To investigate the electrochemical energy storage mechanism of $\text{ZnO}/\text{ZnS}$ nanostructures hydrothermally grown on Ni foam (NF) substrates.
- **Finding**: Electron microscopy-based methodologies were used to evaluate the morphology, structure, and composition of the nanostructures. The $\text{ZnO}/\text{ZnS}$ decorated NF showed a predominant pseudocapacitive behavior. Mott-Schottky and open circuit potential measurements suggest that the $\text{ZnS}$ decoration enhances NF performance by acting as a crucial hole reservoir, highlighting the pivotal role of interface engineering in charge storage.

- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To grow and characterize the structural and magnetic properties of epitaxial $\text{Fe-Sn}$ kagome thin films, including $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$ (ferromagnet) and $\text{FeSn}$ (antiferromagnet), and mixed-phase intergrowths.
- **Finding**: High-quality epitaxial films of $\text{Fe}_3\text{Sn}_2$, $\text{FeSn}$, and mixed-phase intergrowths were successfully produced. Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM) was used to characterize the crystallographic phase content. Magnetic measurements correlated strongly with the predicted ferromagnetic phase content, and a unique temperature-dependent coercivity behavior was discovered in the highly mixed phase alloys.

- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To establish a micro-pulling-down ($\mu$PD) apparatus for growing high-quality Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) single crystals and perform detailed material characterization.
- **Finding**: The $\mu$PD method successfully produced NiTi single crystals with reduced oxygen contamination.

**47. [Precipitate size evolution in an ultrafine-grained magnesium-manganese alloy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05619v1)**
- **Authors**: Julian M. Rosalie, Brian R. Pauw, Anton Hohenwarter
- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To study the evolution of $\alpha$-Mn precipitate size and volume fraction in an ultrafine-grained $\text{Mg-1.35wt.}\%\text{Mn}$ alloy subjected to room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT).
- **Finding**: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and X-ray scattering showed that while the volume fraction of nm-scale $\alpha$-Mn particles increased with applied strain, the mean particle size did not increase over the course of HPT. The size distribution analysis suggested that precipitate growth was limited by interfacial control rather than Mn diffusivity, which remained low at room temperature.

- **Date**: 2026-01-09
- **Objective**: To quantify how residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity in $\text{SiGe}$ virtual substrates affects the interface structure and potential qubit variability in overlying strained-silicon ($\text{s-Si})/\text{Si}_{0.7}\text{Ge}_{0.3}$ heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Spatially-aligned measurements revealed a strong interplay between strain and interface roughness. Cross-sectional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) provided structural confirmation of the interface morphology. Modeling based on measured strains suggests that strain inhomogeneity may cause spurious double-dot qubit detunings of $0.1$ meV over $100$ nm distances, informing strategies for improved buffer layer growth.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a new layered material, $\text{CrGe}_{1-x}\text{Se}_{3+y}$.
- **Finding**: Single crystal X-ray diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) determined the crystal structure, revealing a space group $R\bar{3}m$ with a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms sandwiched between disordered $\text{Ge-Se}$ layers. The compound exhibits antiferromagnetic order below $50$ K, contrasting with the ferromagnetic behavior of the analogous $\text{CrGeTe}_3$.

- **Date**: 2026-01-08
- **Objective**: To perform atomic-scale analysis of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) in Nb and $\text{Ta}$-encapsulated Nb thin films used for superconducting qubits.
- **Finding**: Atom-Probe Tomography (APT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed significant oxygen segregation at GBs in both film types. The oxygen enrichment factor ($C_{\text{gb}}/C_{\text{grain}}$) was quantified, showing that higher oxygen concentration within the Nb grains leads to greater segregation at GBs. Increased oxygen concentration in both grains and GBs correlates directly with the suppression of the critical temperature ($T_c$), providing microscopic insight into decoherence mechanisms.
