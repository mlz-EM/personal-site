- **Authors**: Rajendra Kumar, Govardan Gopakumar, Zain Ul Abdin, Michael J. Manfra, Oana Malis
- **Date**: 2025-07-11
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the molecular-beam epitaxy of short-period Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN superlattices to achieve low-defect complex multilayers for quantum photonic devices.
- **Finding**: X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping confirmed lattice-matching at $x = 0.14$ Sc composition, with superlattices deviating from this condition exhibiting strain-induced defects. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigation of the Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor influencing nitride composition variation and implicitly the band structure profile along the growth direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) further revealed that Sc incorporation exhibits delays relative to Al at both onset and termination, leading to optimized growth conditions identified at approximately $600^\circ C$ and $550^\circ C$ for superlattices with thick and ultra-thin GaN layers, respectively.

- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that interfacial polarization can robustly modulate the surface work function in metallic rutile RuO$_2$ layers within epitaxial RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$ heterostructures.
- **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography was used to directly visualize polar displacements of transition metal ions relative to oxygen octahedra near the interface, despite the conductive nature of RuO$_2$. This interfacial polarization enabled over 1 eV modulation of the RuO$_2$ work function, controlled by small thickness variations (2-4 nm) as measured by Kelvin probe microscopy, with a critical thickness of 4 nm corresponding to the transition from fully strained to relaxed film. These results establish interfacial polarization as a powerful route to control electronic properties in metals for designing tunable electronic, catalytic, and quantum devices.

- **Authors**: Hossein Mirdamadi, Jiří David, Rui Wang, Tianle Jiang, Yanming Wang, Karel Vařeka, Michal Dymáček, Petr Bábor, Tomáš Šikola, Miroslav Kolíbal
- **Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Objective**: To study the dynamics of graphene etching by various molecules (O$_2$, H$_2$, and CO) within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between multilayer graphene and a platinum substrate, identifying kinetic limitations.
- **Finding**: In situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments were employed to study the dynamics of graphene etching. Under the explored experimental conditions (up to $p = 1.4 \times 10^{-3}$ Pa and $T = 1000^\circ C$), the etching reaction rates were found to be limited by mass transport within the confined vdW space. This limitation persisted even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting of the vdW gap. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further revealed multiple etching pathways for CO, enabled by confinement within the vdW space, demonstrating that the vdW gap acts as an effective nanoreactor once mass-transport limitations are overcome.

- **Authors**: Shake Karapetyan, Steven E. Zeltmann, Glen Wilk, Ta-Kun Chen, Vincent D. -H. Hou, David A. Muller
- **Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Objective**: To apply multislice electron ptychography (MEP) for 3D atomic-scale metrology of strain relaxation and roughness in next-generation gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, addressing performance-limiting fabrication challenges.
- **Finding**: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational electron microscopy technique with sub-Ångström lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution, enabled 3D imaging of buried features in prototype gate-all-around transistors. The technique uncovered and quantified distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. It was found that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a bulk-like structure. MEP also quantified the interface roughness, showing different atomic-scale profiles for the top and bottom interfaces, providing direct experimental values for these performance-limiting parameters.

- **Authors**: Tamazouzt Chennit, Songge Li, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Christoph Hofer, Nadine J. Schrenker, Liberato Manna, Sara Bals, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
- **Date**: 2025-07-09
- **Objective**: To investigate the convergence properties of iterative electron ptychography methods under low electron doses, with particular attention to the impact of user-defined update strengths on atomic-resolution imaging.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that carefully chosen, relatively small update strengths for both the object and probe are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential in iterative electron ptychography, especially under low electron doses ($< 10^3$ $e^-/Å^2$). Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_3$) sample, it was shown that convergence is practically achievable only when these update strengths are relatively small. Additionally, under low electron doses, the initial reconstruction error increases when update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold, emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which algorithms are trapped in local minima.

- **Finding**: The review highlights that free-standing bilayer graphene (BLG) serves as a stable, chemically inert template that enables the study of the atomic structure of intercalated 2D materials using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was discovered that the protecting action of graphene sheets not only stabilizes encapsulated single sheets of marginally stable layered materials but also allows the synthesis of completely new 2D systems inside BLG. Compared to bulk graphite, BLG offers easier intercalation and a much larger increase in the interlayer separation of the sheets, providing unique opportunities for manufacturing and tuning optoelectronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties of 2DMs.

Three types of defects were identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl$_2$ domains, and Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl$_3$ domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. The research also revealed a previously unreported crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe$_5$Cl$_{18}$, advancing the understanding of 2D material intercalation mechanisms and highlighting the profound impact of atomic-scale defects on their properties and potential technological applications.

- **Authors**: Yue Pan, Shiyu Zhen, Xiaozhi Liu, Mengshu Ge, Jianxiong Zhao, Lin Gu, Dan Zhou, Liang Zhang, Dong Su
- **Date**: 2025-07-07
- **Objective**: To uncover the mechanism of metal-support interaction in heterogeneous catalysts during redox reactions, specifically focusing on NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ catalysts during hydrogen oxidation.
- **Finding**: Utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy, the study uncovered a type of looping metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ catalysts during hydrogen oxidation reaction. It was observed that lattice oxygens at the NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ interfaces react with NiFe-activated H atoms, gradually sacrificing themselves and resulting in dynamically migrating interfaces. Simultaneously, reduced iron atoms migrate to the {111} surface of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support and react with oxygen molecules. This demonstrated that the hydrogen oxidation reaction spatially separates on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support through the dynamic migration of metal-support interfaces, providing previously unidentified atomic-scale mechanistic insights.

- **Finding**: The study developed TMFP, which incorporates an image degradation model and a reconstruction pipeline inspired by speckle interferometry. By taking multiple short-exposure, randomly-distorted measurements and exploiting their statistical properties, the diffraction-limited sub-aperture images could be recovered for further FP reconstruction. Numerical simulations and experimental validations under optical turbulence demonstrated the method's robustness, resolution enhancement, and practicality in adverse conditions, paving the way for the reliable deployment of high-resolution macroscopic FP in real-world scenarios, despite the challenges posed by atmospheric turbulence.

- **Date**: 2025-07-04
- **Objective**: To develop an approach based on automatic differentiation (AD) for subpixel correction of diffraction pattern shifts in ptychography, addressing issues caused by misalignment during reconstruction.
- **Finding**: The study presents an approach based on automatic differentiation (AD) where the cropping shift of diffraction patterns is treated as an optimizable parameter within the ptychographic reconstruction framework. By integrating shift correction into the backpropagation loop, the method simultaneously refines the object, probe, and shift positions without requiring manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrated that, even with initial offsets ranging up to 5 pixels, the proposed method achieves subpixel correction, with an average deviation below 0.5 pixels. Experiments in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime further validated the method's robustness and effectiveness, enhancing the automation and fidelity of ptychographic reconstructions.

- **Date**: 2025-07-04
- **Objective**: To synthesize and deposit barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets and conduct comprehensive structural and magnetic microscopies to understand their properties for advanced technological applications.

Magnetic properties were analyzed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Relevant size distributions and nanoparticle configurations for magnetic interactions were experimentally identified and numerically analyzed. For dense nanoparticle arrangements, direct exchange coupling dominates with parallel magnetization configuration in overlapping particles, while separated particles exhibit anti-parallel coupling. Detailed micro-magnetic modeling elucidated the length scales over which these two interaction regimes are dominant, paving the way for macroscopic 2D and 3D structures with tuned magnetic ordering.

- **Date**: 2025-07-04
- **Objective**: To investigate the specific role of well-defined $\Sigma$3(111) grain boundaries (GBs) in accelerating hydrogen insertion and removal in palladium (Pd) nanostructures.
- **Finding**: In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed that Pd nanostructures enriched with $\Sigma$3(111) GBs exhibited dramatically accelerated hydriding and dehydriding kinetics compared to other Pd nanoparticles. Environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) was used for strain mapping, which showed that strain is highly localized at GBs and intensifies upon hydrogen exposure, indicating preferential hydrogen insertion along GB sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported these findings, demonstrating that hydrogen insertion near $\Sigma$3(111) GBs is energetically more favorable and that tensile strain lowers insertion barriers, providing atomic-level insights into the role of GBs in hydride formation.

- **Finding**: A "remote salt" strategy enabled the growth of high-quality coaxial NbS$_2$ nanotubes on single-walled carbon nanotube-boron nitride nanotube (SWCNT-BNNT) templates, with morphologies controlled from 1D nanotubes to suspended 2D flakes. Structural characterization via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the formation of crystalline NbS$_2$ nanotubes, revealing a distinct bi-layer preference. Optical analyses highlighted the metallic nature of NbS$_2$, and Raman analysis showed relatively higher degradation rates under ambient conditions.

- **Finding**: Using a relativistic quantum kinetic framework and numerical solutions of the Dirac equation, the study revealed coherent multiphoton exchange involving up to $10^4$ photons and the emergence of attosecond-zeptosecond electron sub-bunches after free-space propagation. This pulse compression mechanism is robust to laser pulse duration but sensitive to the initial momentum spread of the particles/beams. The proposed mechanism for achieving electron pulses in zeptosecond time scales offers potential for ultrafast coherent control of quantum states, opening new avenues in high-resolution temporal structuring of electron beams for time-resolved quantum technologies and attosecond-zeptosecond science, as well as for application in high-resolution electron microscopy.

High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in STEM provided feedback for feedback-controlled monitoring of structural evolution. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode HAADF images and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected, demonstrating a material-agnostic framework for creating diverse defect structures.

- **Authors**: Hao Geng, Qiaofei Pan, Jian Kang, Yiming Pan
- **Date**: 2025-07-01
- **Objective**: To propose a novel photon-induced pairing mechanism to generate a net attractive force between electrons in high-intensity ultrafast electron beams, aiming to mitigate space-charge interactions and enhance beam coherence.
- **Finding**: The study proposes treating electrons as a strongly correlated Fermi gas and introduces a photon-induced pairing mechanism that generates a net attractive force between two electrons, forming "flying bound states" analogous to Cooper pairs. Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), it was demonstrated that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability mediated by structured electromagnetic fields at near-resonant velocity matching regimes. This mechanism underscores the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, which can further enhance beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electrons.

- **Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Objective**: To investigate the relationship between structural disorder and the establishment of superconducting phase coherence in a highly disordered fractal MgO/MgB$_2$ nanocomposite.
- **Finding**: 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data revealed that the complex MgO/MgB$_2$ microstructure spreads isotropically throughout the sample with a constant fractal dimension of $\sim 1.67$. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) further revealed that the MgO/MgB$_2$ interfaces are atomically clean and free from amorphous grain boundaries, even leading to atomically coherent interfaces. Spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence measurements demonstrated that oxygen vacancies in the MgO-rich phase tend to aggregate near the MgO/MgB$_2$ boundary regions, forming long channels of oxygen vacancies through the nanocomposite. These channels contribute to long-range carrier transfer and Andreev reflection via coherent tunneling, explaining the bulk-like superconducting properties despite the low volume fraction of MgB$_2$.
