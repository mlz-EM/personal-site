**1. [Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323v1)**
- **Authors**: Rama Srinivas Varanasi, Motomichi Koyama, Shuya Chiba, Saya Ajito, Eiji Akiyama
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Objective**: To clarify the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior and the underlying fast fracture mechanism in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel.
- **Finding**: Hydrogen pre-charging led to brittle fracture at 900 MPa within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies indicated intergranular and quasi-cleavage crack initiation. Site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were crucial, revealing sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite and, later, predominant brittle fracture with $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage cracking. Transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) confirmed the $\{100\}$ ferrite cleavage, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) studies on cross-sectional cracks further supported the proposed hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism, where high crack velocity inhibits crack blunting and sustains brittle growth.

**2. [Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166v1)**
- **Authors**: Esther C. Hessong, Zhengyu Zhang, Tianjiao Lei, Mingjie Xu, Toshihiro Aoki, Timothy J. Rupert
- **Date**: 2025-09-07
- **Objective**: To understand how dopants self-organize and alter local structure within amorphous interfacial complexions in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys.
- **Finding**: Chemical partitioning was observed in both grain and interphase boundaries, with the amorphous-crystalline transition region showing enrichment/depletion of specific dopant species. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and elemental analysis were used to study these boundaries and confirm chemical partitioning. While nanobeam electron diffraction provided qualitative structural short-range order, atomistic simulations were then used to quantitatively probe how dopant patterning affects local structural states, revealing that increased grain boundary chemical complexity leads to a more disordered complexion structure.

- **Authors**: Kuan Ding, Atsutomo Nakamura, Patrick Cordier, Xufei Fang
- **Date**: 2025-09-05
- **Objective**: To understand the fundamental processes of dislocation-grain boundary (GB) interaction in polycrystalline ceramics using a bi-crystal SrTiO$_{3}$ model system with a low-angle tilt GB, aiming to develop strategies for crack suppression.
- **Finding**: Room-temperature Brinell indentation generated a plastic zone without crack formation, allowing direct assessment of GB-dislocation interaction. Dislocation etch pits imaging and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were employed to observe dislocation pileup, storage, and transmission across the $4^{\circ}$ tilt GB, which consists of an array of edge dislocations.

- **Finding**: HDPC measurements showed a distinct change in dependence on incident angle between 5 nm and 10 nm $\alpha$-Sn films. Combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, this revealed a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a two-dimensional (2D) to a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator occurring between these thicknesses. HR-TEM provided crucial structural information supporting the understanding of the film growth and interface quality, confirming the ability of HDPC to sensitively diagnose topological phase transitions.

**8. [Fidelity-preserving enhancement of ptychography with foundational text-to-image models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04513v1)**
- **Authors**: Ming Du, Volker Rose, Junjing Deng, Dileep Singh, Si Chen, Mathew J. Cherukara
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Objective**: To develop a plug-and-play (PnP) framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided image editing using foundational diffusion models to enhance ptychographic imaging by removing artifacts while preserving fidelity.
- **Finding**: The proposed framework, using an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), successfully ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal, maintaining physics consistency.

- **Finding**: After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction, k-means clustering identified four distinct clusters, which were mapped back to the diffraction data. 4D-STEM was critical for acquiring detailed diffraction patterns across scanned regions, providing rich structural information. Elemental intensity histograms derived from the data revealed chemical signatures (oxygen, germanium, tellurium, antimony enrichment) across these clusters, and averaged diffraction patterns confirmed structural variations. This demonstrated that clustering analysis of 4D-STEM data provides a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in phase-change materials, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.

- **Finding**: Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer was achieved, exhibiting low resistivity along the [0001] direction and an approximately tenfold anisotropy, consistent with bulk CoSn. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was crucial in revealing the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films, which contribute to the observed surface roughness and affect resistivity evaluation. These microstructural insights provided by STEM highlight both the potential and challenges of using CoSn in future interconnect technologies.

**11. [Molecular Beam Epitaxy of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21537v1)**
- **Authors**: Constantin Hilbrunner, Tobias Meyer, Joerg Malindretos, Angela Rizzi
- **Date**: 2025-08-29
- **Objective**: To epitaxially grow $2H$-TaS$_{2}$ few-layers on GaN(0001) and characterize their structural and electronic properties for potential integration with 3D semiconducting materials.
- **Finding**: High substrate growth temperature ($825^{\circ}$C) induced optimal structural properties, with the $2H$-TaS$_{2}$ overlayer growing unstrained after monolayer deposition. In-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED) confirmed the structural quality. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provided crucial evidence of pits at the interface, likely due to GaN thermal decomposition at high growth temperatures. Despite these pits, in-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) indicated electron transfer from n-GaN(0001) to $2H$-TaS$_{2}$ and nitrogen vacancy formation near the interface, without chemical reaction, corroborating the possibility of integrating $2H$-TaS$_{2}$ with GaN.

- **Finding**: A sulfuric acid-based etching method was demonstrated to effectively etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\mu$m of material from the surface over 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with back-scattered electron spectroscopy (BSE) was used to study the surface morphology and contamination of the titanium samples, providing direct visual evidence of the successful removal of surface contaminants after etching. This method offers a safer alternative to conventional hydrofluoric acid etching, which is crucial for deep underground laboratory construction.

- **Finding**: Thermal vacuum annealing with aluminum as an oxygen getter successfully triggered the topotactic phase transition from PV to BM, confirmed by X-ray Diffraction. This transition was accompanied by a change from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic and metallic to insulating states. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was employed, along with X-ray Reflectivity and Atomic Force Microscopy, to reveal surface segregation and cation redistribution during the annealing process, providing critical microstructural insights into the phase transformation and its impact on physical properties.

**14. [Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20930v1)**
- **Authors**: Elzbieta Gradauskaite, Natascha Gray, Quintin N. Meier, Marta D. Rossell, Morgan Trassin
- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To control polarization direction and chiral textures in BiFeO$_{3}$ (BFO) thin films by leveraging the interplay between epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry.
- **Finding**: Large anisotropic compressive strain promoted ferroelectric domain formation in BFO films on La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO)-buffered NdGaO$_{3}$ substrates. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were crucial in revealing that the resulting nanoscale domain architecture is stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization. This mechanism allowed for the stabilization of a uniform out-of-plane polarization by inserting a Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer layer, and local polarization switching experiments revealed signatures of homochiral polarization textures, offering new strategies for functional domain-wall and domain-based electronics.

- **Date**: 2025-08-28
- **Objective**: To improve the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching.
- **Finding**: Surface scratching along the [100] direction using a Brinell indenter effectively generated edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for surface morphology analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided crucial microstructural characterization, revealing that these introduced dislocations significantly mitigated the formation of cleavage cracks during subsequent nanoindentation tests. The mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers played an important role in preventing brittle fracture by facilitating stable plastic deformation, thereby toughening the material.

- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced experimental techniques and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrated that broad transitional regions observed in previous studies are projection artifacts from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of $180^{\circ}$ domain walls, which are a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was critical for this finding, especially through imaging strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Simulations, enabled by a deep neural network-based interatomic potential, confirmed that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, explaining the zigzag domain walls and observed nucleation-limited switching behavior.

- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Objective**: To investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by global annealing or localized laser-induced heating, focusing on their structural and electronic properties for phase-change memory applications.
- **Finding**: The highly conductive $\gamma$-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline $\alpha$-GeSe while preserving crystal orientation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was essential for investigating the distinct structural and electronic properties at the $\gamma$-GeSe/$\alpha$-GeSe interface. The study proposes that clustering of Ge vacancies in the $\gamma$-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures drives the transition, leading to $\alpha$-GeSe formation through minor GeSe$_{2}$ phase segregation. A high electrical resistance contrast of approximately $10^{7}$ between the two polymorphs was observed, highlighting GeSe's potential for electronic applications.

- **Authors**: Zhida Liang, Fengxian Liu, Xin Liu, Yang Li, Yinan Cui, Florian Pyczak
- **Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Objective**: To investigate a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon of Shockley partial dislocations within the $\gamma'$ phase of CoNi-based superalloys and understand the underlying mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study presents evidence of Shockley partial dislocations (a/6$<112>$) cross-slipping from one $\{111\}$ plane to another $\{111\}$ conjugate plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered $\gamma'$ phase. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize defects like stacking faults and dislocations, along with associated chemical fluctuations. Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy for cross-slip by decreasing stacking fault and dislocation energies, with local stress concentrations also playing a critical role, ultimately enhancing the alloy's high-temperature deformation resistance.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was critical for dislocation analysis, revealing that Mo substitution in the L1$_{2}$ phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting multiple deformation modes including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These observations, supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations, demonstrated how the low stacking fault energy (SFE) of the FCC matrix and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries (APBs) contribute to the enhanced mechanical properties.
