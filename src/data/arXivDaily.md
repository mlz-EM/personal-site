-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that reliable and successful image reconstructions are achievable in simulated 2D position-blind ptychography, even under measurement noise, by using the right illumination structure and strong data-driven image priors (score-based diffusion models). While not directly an EM technique, **Ptychography** is a computational imaging technique widely used in electron microscopy (e.g., electron ptychography) for high-resolution imaging, and this work explores fundamental challenges in such coherent diffractive imaging methods when positional information is absent, which is relevant for future advanced electron imaging scenarios.

Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
-   **Date**: 2025-09-26
-   **Objective**: Investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling in Ru-capped RuO$_{2}$/Fe bilayers, specifically to determine if it arises from altermagnetism in RuO$_{2}$ or other interfacial phenomena.
-   **Finding**: The observed exchange bias in RuO$_{2}$/Fe bilayers was found to be driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer (containing Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$) at the interface, rather than altermagnetism in RuO$_{2}$. **Cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** was crucial in revealing the formation and structure of this iron oxide interlayer, providing direct microstructural evidence that helped to clarify the non-altermagnetic origin of the exchange bias behavior.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-26
-   **Objective**: Investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten in air and the sublimation of tungsten oxide at various temperatures and durations to assess their impact on fusion power plant lifecycles.
-   **Finding**: Oxidation of tungsten at temperatures above 600°C led to the formation of voids, cracks, dust, or oxide spalling, which are problematic for fusion power plant maintenance. **Electron microscopy** (along with Raman spectroscopy) was used to characterize the oxide scale, revealing a three-layered structure: an inner WO$_{2}$ layer (30-50 nm), a middle WO$_{2.72}$ layer (10-20 $\mu$m), and an outer WO$_{2.9}$/WO$_{3}$ layer, providing microstructural insights into the oxidation kinetics and its implications for tritium permeation.

**36. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
-   **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
-   **Date**: 2025-09-25
-   **Objective**: Develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method to overcome the limitations of speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA systems and exploit speckle to improve resolution.
-   **Finding**: The study demonstrated that sequential measurements with per-measurement-independent speckle fundamentally prevent SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes. They developed a snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome this. While not directly an EM technique, the principles of synthetic aperture imaging are relevant to advanced microscopy. The authors further showed, in simulation, that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information, thereby improving the resolution of SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures.

-   **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
-   **Date**: 2025-09-24
-   **Objective**: Investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$ by examining its crystalline structure and defects.
-   **Finding**: While single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) showed highly ordered lattices, **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** measurements revealed tiny amounts of interstitial defects on the Te$_{2}$ layers. These defects are argued to cause slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters and are sufficient to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$, highlighting the critical role of structural disorder, detectable at the atomic scale by STEM, in determining superconducting properties.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-20
-   **Objective**: Investigate the size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes using in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy.
-   **Finding**: The study observed a melting point depression of CDWs in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$ nanoflakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm, and even absence of CDWs in very small flakes, consistent with classical nucleation theory. **In-situ cryogenic electron microscopy** with temperature down to 20 K was crucial for directly observing these size-dependent effects, demonstrating how finite flake size cuts off the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition, thereby lowering the transition temperature.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-19
-   **Objective**: Develop a digital correction method for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images to accurately estimate the true surface pore size and porosity of nanoporous membranes, accounting for artifacts from high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings.

-   **Date**: 2025-09-16
-   **Objective**: Investigate the underlying degradation mechanisms, specifically morphological and chemical changes, in Cd-free colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) during operation.
-   **Finding**: Cd-free QD-LEDs undergo nanoscale morphological changes (interparticle coarsening and layer thinning) in the ETL, QD emissive layer, and organic hole transport layer during operation, accompanied by the generation and diffusion of oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals. **In situ transmission electron microscopy** revealed that electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO NPs coarsening. Acrylate-based resin-encapsulation stabilized the layers by suppressing radical formation and halting morphology changes, leading to dramatic lifetime enhancements.
