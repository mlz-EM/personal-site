**1. [Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04045v1)**
- **Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To propose a new self-supervised machine learning (ML) pipeline for denoising low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time-series High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images quickly enough for in situ analysis.
- **Finding**: The pipeline, which integrates a blind-spot convolution neural network with drift correction and low-pass filtering, significantly outperforms other ML and non-ML methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, improving the visual clarity of atomic features. The model achieves inference speeds in the order of milliseconds per image and demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution generalization, making it suitable for real-time application in in-situ HRTEM experiments under low-dose conditions.

- **Authors**: Billy E. Yang, Saeed S. I. Almishal, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Mary Kathleen Caucci, Gerald Bejger, Christina M. Rost, Nasim Alem, Susan B. Sinnott, Jon-Paul Maria
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To construct a temperature-composition phase diagram for $\text{CeO}_{2}$-$\text{LA}_{2}\text{O}_{3}$ high entropy oxides (HEOs) and delineate the stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and intermediate vacancy-ordered fluorite phases.
- **Finding**: A comprehensive characterization suite was used to map the phase boundaries, revealing local structural order (bixbyite) invisible to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) but detectable by Raman spectroscopy. TEM electron diffraction was critical for quantifying the crystal structure at multiple length-scales, confirming that quenched kinetic energy in thin films can metastabilize the high-symmetry fluorite phase with an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice (estimated at $16.7\%$).

**3. [Interfacial Control of Orbital Occupancy and Spin State in LaCoO$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03785v1)**
- **Authors**: Ellen M. Kiens, Nicolas Gauquelin, Arno Annys, Emma van der Minne, Iris C. G. van den Bosch, Matthijs A. van Spronsen, Zezhong Zhang, Annick de Backer, Sandra van Aert, Jo Verbeeck, Gertjan Koster, Bastian Mei, Frank M. F. de Groot, Christoph Baeumer
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy in $\text{LaCoO}_{3}$ from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state through interfacial engineering with various perovskite substrates.
- **Finding**: Interfacial charge transfer successfully governed the Co valence and spin state, with $\text{LaTiO}_{3}$ and $\text{LaMnO}_{3}$ interfaces resulting in partial $d^7$ occupancy, and $\text{LaNiO}_{3}$ resulting in partial $d^5$ occupancy. High-resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging revealed a clear connection between interfacial strain and the resulting spin configuration, such as the Co $d^6$ low spin state induced by a $\text{LaAlO}_{3}$ spacer layer, demonstrating that interfacial engineering simultaneously controls orbital occupancy and spin state.

- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To introduce photonic time-stretch fieldoscopy, enabling single-shot electric-field detection at near-petahertz frequencies, overcoming the need for temporal scanning and averaging.
- **Finding**: Numerical results demonstrate that integrating fieldoscopy with a nonlinear time lens allows for the real-time acquisition of ultrashort optical waveforms with a detection bandwidth approaching petahertz. This large temporal aperture and attosecond resolution enable the direct single-shot detection of transient electric fields generated in solid or liquid samples, opening new avenues for ultrafast spectro-microscopy.

- **Authors**: George Serghiou, Hans Josef Reichmann, Gang Ji, Laurence Nigay, Jonathan P. Wright, Daniel J. Frost, Gus Calder
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To synthesize and characterize a new class of hexagonal Ge-Sn solid solutions by subjecting Ge and Sn to high pressure and temperature.
- **Finding**: Applying pressures up to 10 GPa and temperatures up to 1500 K resulted in the ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal 2H, 4H, and 6H Ge-Sn solid solutions ($\text{P}6_{3}/\text{mmc}$), accessible below 21 atom \% Sn. Precession Electron Diffraction (PED) and chemical analysis using electron microscopy were crucial for identifying the recovered hexagonal crystal symmetries and correlating their formation with Sn uptake, establishing a new binary materials landscape for optoelectronic applications.

**6. [On the Accuracy of Atomic Resolution Electrostatic Measurements in 2D Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03372v1)**
- **Authors**: Rafael V. Ferreira, Sebastian Calderon V., Paulo J. Ferreira
- **Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Objective**: To evaluate the influence of key instrumental parameters (probe convergence angle, defocus, and two-fold astigmatism) on the accuracy of atomic-resolution electrostatic measurements using segmented-detector Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).
- **Finding**: Extensive image simulations demonstrated that instrumental misalignment significantly compromises measurement accuracy; for a 21 mrad probe, electrostatic field magnitude can be underestimated by up to $16\%$ in overfocus, while two-fold astigmatism introduces orientation-dependent variations surpassing $40\%$ for small magnitudes. The analysis confirms the sensitivity of the scattergram-based method and stresses the critical need for optimized instrumental alignment to ensure accurate CoM-based STEM imaging.

**7. [Microscopic evidence of dominant excitonic instability in Ta2NiSe5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03011v1)**
- **Authors**: Seokjin Bae, Arjun Raghavan, Irena Feldman, Amit Kanigel, Vidya Madhavan
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: To provide microscopic evidence supporting an excitonic origin for the insulating phase in $\text{Ta}_{2}\text{NiSe}_{5}$, distinguishing it from the accompanying structural distortion.
- **Finding**: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy (STM/STS) showed that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent. Furthermore, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles, and the decay length of the in-gap states matches the estimated exciton wavefunction size. These findings collectively suggest that $\text{Ta}_{2}\text{NiSe}_{5}$ is an intrinsic excitonic insulator (EI).

**8. [Realization of polytype heterostructures via delicate structural transitions from a doped-Mott insulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02778v1)**
- **Authors**: Yanyan Geng, Manyu Wang, Shumin Meng, Shuo Mi, Chang Li, Huiji Hu, Jianfeng Guo, Rui Xu, Fei Pang, Wei Ji, Weichang Zhou, Zhihai Cheng
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: To realize vertical and lateral T-H polytype heterostructures in a hole-doped Mott insulator via thermal-annealing-induced structural transitions.
- **Finding**: Atomic-scale Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements revealed the coexistence of T-H polytype heterostructures and demonstrated a "transparent effect" in $1\text{H}/1\text{T}$ vertical heterostructures, where the charge density wave (CDW) of the underlying $1\text{T}$ layer influences the top $1\text{H}$ layer. The metallic $1\text{H}$ layer imposes a Coulomb screening effect on the $1\text{T}$ layer, suppressing CDW domain walls and forming more ordered electronic states.

- **Authors**: Nicolai-Leonid Bathen, Thorsten Deilmann, Ana Senkić, Hendrik Lambers, Rami Dana, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Frances M. Ross, Julian Klein, Ursula Wurstbauer
- **Date**: 2025-12-02
- **Objective**: To establish micro-Raman spectroscopy of optical moiré phonons as a rapid, non-invasive probe for precise determination and mapping of local twist angle variations in twisted $\text{WSe}_{2}$ bilayers.
- **Finding**: Combined Lateral Force Microscopy (LFM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy revealed lateral twist angle variations exceeding $1^{\circ}$ across micrometer length scales. Distinct Raman responses from optical moiré phonons in the $3^{\circ} < \alpha < 12^{\circ}$ range allow for twist angle determination with a precision better than $\pm 0.3^{\circ}$ and sub-micrometer spatial resolution, providing a critical tool for screening emergent quantum phases.

**10. [Evaluation of carbon incorporation in sulfide thin films grown by hybrid pulsed laser deposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02168v1)**
- **Authors**: Claire Wu, Mythili Surendran, Shin Muramoto, Alexander Grutter, Jayakanth Ravichandran
- **Date**: 2025-12-01
- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of carbon (C)-containing side products generated from organosulfur precursor pyrolysis on the growth and properties of sulfide thin films grown by hybrid pulsed laser deposition (hPLD).
- **Finding**: Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), combined with secondary ion mass spectrometry, showed that C incorporation is minimized at optimal growth temperatures ($400^{\circ}\text{C}$ for ZnS, $500^{\circ}\text{C}$ for $\text{TiS}_{2}$, $700^{\circ}\text{C}$ for $\text{BaTiS}_{3}$). Growth outside these optimal ranges leads to increased C incorporation and degraded texture, likely due to C graphitization poisoning the interface and bulk, especially evident in $\text{TiS}_{2}$.

- **Finding**: Iron oxide particles were synthesized inside nanopores (ranging from $1.7$ to $64.6\text{ nm}$ in diameter), leading to pore sealing on timescales from milliseconds to seconds. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Aberration-Corrected Scanning TEM (AC-STEM) verified the synthesis of mixed magnetite and maghemite iron oxide, confirming the material structure within the membranes and advancing nanoparticle-nanopore chips for biosensing and plasmonics.

- **Date**: 2025-11-30
- **Objective**: To establish a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of monolayer graphene on insulating perovskite oxide substrates using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
- **Finding**: Uniform, continuous monolayer graphene was successfully grown directly on $\text{SrTiO}_{3}$, $\text{LaAlO}_{3}$, and $(\text{La}_{0.18}\text{Sr}_{0.82})(\text{Al}_{0.59}\text{Ta}_{0.41})\text{O}_{3}$ substrates under the same optimal conditions. Electron microscopy confirmed the high quality of the graphene layer. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) of the graphene/$\text{SrTiO}_{3}$ interface revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling, validating this transfer-free fabrication route.

Tănase, Aleksandra Miaskiewicz, Sebastian Weitz, Jing-Wen Hsueh, Mohamad-Assaad Mawass, Lucas de Souza Caldas, Suresh Manyarasu, Philippe Holzhey, Erik Wutke, Stepan Demchyshyn, Matthew R. Leyden, Angelika Harter, Roberto Felix Duarte, Jona Kurpiers, Philipp Wagner, Bernd Stannovski, Ljiljana Puskar, Roland Mainz, Daniel Abou-Ras, Thomas Schmidt, Lars Korte, Marcel Roß, Steve Albrecht
- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that a CsCl seed layer can homogenize the growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite films on textured silicon bottom cells, preventing the formation of residual $\text{PbI}_{2}$.
- **Finding**: The CsCl seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation across the hole-transporting material/perovskite interface, preventing interfacial $\text{PbI}_{2}$ formation and leading to larger apparent grains, which resulted in a certified tandem solar cell efficiency of $29.7\%$. X-ray Photoemission Electron Microscopy (XPEEM) was used to reveal that the seed layer promotes uniform precursor incorporation, even in areas with thin hole-transporting material coverage.

- **Authors**: Hiroshi Nakajima, Satoshi Hiroi, Hirofumi Tsukasaki, Yonghong Bing, Stéphane Grenier, Zuo-Guang Ye, Pierre-Eymeric Janolin, Shigeo Mori
- **Date**: 2025-11-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the ferroelectric microstructures and dynamic behavior of chemically ordered ferroelectric $\text{Pb}(\text{Sc}_{1/2}\text{Nb}_{1/2})\text{O}_{3}$ (PSN).
- **Finding**: In-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with dark-field imaging revealed intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains in ordered PSN, indicating that electric polarization fluctuates around the [111] direction despite the long-range rhombohedral order, resulting in unique weak relaxor properties. In-situ heating successfully captured the dynamic movement of domain walls and the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence near the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition.

- **Authors**: Jisun Kim, Yoosuk Kim, Seung-Ho Park, Yong Hun Ko, Chong-Yun Park
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: To develop a scalable thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy for synthesizing uniform, large-area $\text{WS}_{2}$ thin films by sulfurizing tungsten precursors for optoelectronic applications.
- **Finding**: Sulfurization of sputtered W thin films at the optimal temperature of $800^{\circ}\text{C}$ yielded highly crystalline, stoichiometric, layered $\text{WS}_{2}$ with significantly enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness compared to films grown on W foils. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) collectively validated the structural quality, and Schottky-barrier solar cells fabricated from these films achieved a power conversion efficiency of $1.45\%$.

**16. [Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22002v1)**
- **Authors**: Muxian Xu, Siyu Cheng, Andrea Capa Salinas, Ganesh Pokharel, Alexander LaFleur, Hong Li, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Qinwen Deng, Binghai Yan, Ziqiang Wang, Stephen D. Wilson, Ilija Zeljkovic
- **Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Objective**: To investigate the relationship between electronic nematicity and the $2 \times 2$ charge density wave (CDW) phase in the prototypical kagome superconductor $\text{CsV}_{3}\text{Sb}_{5}$ as a function of doping.
- **Finding**: Spectroscopic Imaging Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (SI-STM) revealed that rotational symmetry breaking (electronic nematicity) persists in short-range nanoscale regions across a wide doping range, even after the long-range CDW phase has been suppressed. This ubiquitous electronic nematicity suggests it is the intrinsic parent state of kagome superconductors, independent of the $2 \times 2$ CDW order.

- **Authors**: Laurens J. M. Westenberg, Lumen Eek, Jort D. Verbakel, Kevin Vonk, Stijn J. H. Borggreve, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Paul de Boeij, Rodrigo Arouca, Cristiane Morais Smith, Pantelis Bampoulis
- **Date**: 2025-11-25
- **Objective**: To achieve direct, real-space imaging of moiré-confined excitons in twisted bilayer $\text{MoS}_{2}$ with nanometer resolution.
- **Finding**: Room-temperature photocurrent Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to image excitons across a $2^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer $\text{MoS}_{2}$, directly resolving site-selective confinement. The results show that direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries within the moiré unit cell, providing crucial, unit-cell-resolved measurements that constrain microscopic models of moiré excitons.

- **Authors**: Shreyashi Sinha, Shantanu Pathak, Saswata Bhattacharya, Sujit Manna
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To develop a controlled mechanical exfoliation technique for 3D topological insulators and use scanning probe techniques to clearly resolve quantum well states (QWS) of Dirac electrons in ultrathin flakes.
- **Finding**: High-resolution Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) on atomically flat terraces of exfoliated $(\text{Bi}_{0.1}\text{Sb}_{0.9})_{2}\text{Te}_{3}$ flakes revealed QWS driven by quantum confinement, an effect rarely observed due to Klein tunneling. The electronic band dispersion extracted from the QWS characteristics aligns well with DFT calculations, and spatially resolved spectroscopy confirmed that these QWS remain robust against surface defect scattering.

**19. [E-coherent crystalline interfaces: coherency enhanced by discohesion arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19298v1)**
- **Authors**: Ryan B. Sills, Alejandro Hinojos, Trevor J. Murray, Shane H. Cooley, Xiaowang W. Zhou, Douglas L. Medlin
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce and characterize a new class of crystalline interfaces, termed "e-coherent," where non-affine relaxations introduce additional coincidence sites via "discohesions."
- **Finding**: Atomistic simulations and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirmed the existence of e-coherent interfaces, where local non-affine transformations introduce line defects called discohesions (topologically equivalent to disconnection dipoles or loops). Unlike traditional defects, discohesions lack long-range stress fields but strongly affect interfacial energetics and kinetics, suggesting that e-coherency is likely a pervasive phenomenon in crystalline solids.

**20. [Detecting Linear Dichroism with Atomic Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18796v1)**
- **Authors**: Roger Guzman, Ján Rusz, Ang Li, Juan Carlos Idrobo, Wu Zhou, Jaume Gazquez
- **Date**: 2025-11-24
- **Objective**: To introduce an electron linear dichroism methodology in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) combined with Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) to probe electronic anisotropies with atomic resolution.
- **Finding**: By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent EELS, the $\text{Mn}-3d$ $e_{g}$ orbital polarization was directly visualized at individual atomic columns in strained $\text{La}_{0.7}\text{Sr}_{0.3}\text{MnO}_{3}$ thin films with sub-angstrom precision. The results showed that compressive strain stabilizes $3z^2-r^2$ occupation while tensile strain favors $x^2-y^2$, validating the approach as a generalizable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phenomena with single atomic-column sensitivity.

- **Finding**: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) obtained the first atomically resolved images of the (111) surfaces, revealing hexagonal or kagome lattices. Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) in $\text{CsBi}_{2}$ showed strong-coupling superconductivity and a magnetic field induced a hexagonal vortex lattice with three-fold symmetry cores. In $\text{Pr}_{2}\text{Ir}_{2}\text{O}_{7}$, a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance was observed, exhibiting a three-fold spatial modulation and atomic site-dependent Zeeman splitting.

**22. [Probing Boundary Spins in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17173v1)**
- **Authors**: Armando A. Aligia, Alejandro M. Lobos, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Claudio J. Gazza
- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Objective**: To propose an experimental method using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) combined with Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) to detect localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain.
- **Finding**: Theoretical modeling suggests that the tip-end-spin coupling in the contact regime realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, leading to a low-bias Kondo peak. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides a clear, indirect signature of these localized spins, supported by Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations of the spin gap and spin projection of end states.

- **Authors**: Ana Senkić, Rachael Keneipp, Petra Ivatović, Namrata Pradeep, Vincent Meunier, Marko Kralj, Marija Drndić, Nataša Vujičić
- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To demonstrate and characterize a tungsten (W) doping-induced structural phase transition between semiconducting polytypes in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown bilayer ($\text{2L}$) $\text{MoS}_{2}$.
- **Finding**: Increasing W concentration induces a phase transition from non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to centrosymmetric $\text{AB}'$ stacking, identified by the vanishing polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) signal and stiffening of the layer-breathing vibrational mode. Aberration Corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (AC-STEM) provided atomic-scale evidence of the spatial distribution of W dopants and the associated structural changes, confirming W-doping as a strategy for phase control in $\text{2L}$ transition metal dichalcogenides.

- **Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Objective**: To introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for accurately determining twist angles in artificially stacked cuprate ($\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{Ca}\text{Cu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$) heterostructures.
- **Finding**: By analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, specifically the out-of-plane $A_{1g}$ mode at $116\text{ cm}^{-1}$, clear optical fingerprints of the rotational misalignment between cuprate layers were identified. This non-invasive method provides reliable and reproducible twist angle quantification without the risk of damaging the sensitive twisted interface, which is a major limitation for conventional electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques.

- **Finding**: GaGeTe exhibits high plasticity, overcoming the inherent brittleness of traditional germanium-based chalcogenides. Spherical Aberration-Corrected Transmission Electron Microscopy (AC-TEM) experiments, combined with DFT calculations, revealed a novel deformation mechanism co-dominated by intralayer lattice distortion and interlayer slip, providing fresh insight into the plastic behavior of inorganic semiconductors for flexible electronic device design.

- **Objective**: To introduce and generate a new class of spatiotemporal plasmonic vortices (STPVs) carrying nontrivial topological spin textures using chronotopic interference of temporally delayed plasmonic eigen-vortices.
- **Finding**: The generation mechanism involves a $\pi$-phase dislocation in the space-frequency domain mapping into a $2\pi$ spiraling phase in space-time. Interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM) was used to directly image the nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution of the STPVs and allowed for control over their vortex number and position.

- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the structural and superconducting properties of high-quality single-crystalline $BiPt$ using a comprehensive range of experimental techniques.
- **Finding**: The study established that $BiPt$ is a weak type-II superconductor with a transition temperature ($T_{c}$) of $1.2$ K, exhibiting pronounced anisotropic superconducting characteristics attributed to its hexagonal crystal structure. Electron microscopy was utilized alongside X-ray diffraction to confirm the high quality and structural properties of the single-crystalline material, supporting the conclusion of conventional s-wave superconductivity that maintains time-reversal symmetry.

- **Date**: 2025-11-19
- **Objective**: To explore the modulation of superconducting vortex bound states by unidirectional charge density waves (CDWs) in the transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor $1T''$-$NbTe_{2}$.
- **Finding**: Ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) revealed elliptical vortices whose elongation aligns with the $3\times1\times3$ CDW stripes, demonstrating strong coupling between vortex morphology and the underlying electronic order.

- **Date**: 2025-11-19
- **Objective**: To develop an atomically dispersed nickel-nitrogen-carbon ($Ni-NC$) catalyst and optimize electrode transport engineering for stable and efficient $CO_{2}$ electrolysis in a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA).
