- **Authors**: Naisargi Kanabar, Seiichiro Higashiya, Daniele Cherniak, Devendra Sadana, Stephen Bedell, Haralabos Efstathiadis
- **Date**: 2025-09-30
- **Objective**: To examine lithium distribution and its evolution in anode and cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate cycling to understand lithium loss, trapping, and plating mechanisms.
- **Finding**: The study used Li nuclear reaction analysis (Li-NRA) to measure lithium depth distribution, revealing a surface lithium peak on the anode (associated with SEI formation and plating) and a decrease in lithium content in the cathode. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) supported these findings, showing structural deformation in the cathode and an enhanced peak in the dead graphite anode, possibly indicating metallic lithium or Cu.

**34. [Electrical resistivity of microstructural components in Al-Mg-Si alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25089v1)**
- **Authors**: Gautam Kumar, Amram Azulay, Omer Coriat, Hanna Bishara
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and corresponding microstructure on the electrical resistivity of overaged Al-Mg-Si alloys.
- **Finding**: The study characterized the crystal structure, composition, and microstructure using techniques including scanning electron microscopy. A microscale four-point probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope was used to directly measure the electrical resistivity of microstructural components (Al solid solution matrix, Si, and Mg$_2$Si precipitates). They found the Al matrix to be up to 15% more resistive than pure Al, and regions with precipitates were equally resistive, linking microscopic and macroscopic resistivity to microstructure and composition.

**35. [Nanoscale Polar Landscapes in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24969v1)**
- **Authors**: Yang Zhang, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari
- **Date**: 2025-09-29
- **Objective**: To directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ to define its real-space structure.
- **Finding**: Using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) down to 20 K, the study revealed a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains of finite polarization in SrTiO$_3$. High-resolution imaging showed that short-range polar domains first grow and self-organize into a periodic structure, but this process reverses below 40 K in the quantum paraelectric regime, leading to fragmentation of ordered polar nanodomains into small clusters.

**36. [Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269v1)**
- **Authors**: Simon Welker, Lorenz Kuger, Tim Roith, Berthy Feng, Martin Burger, Timo Gerkmann, Henry Chapman
- **Date**: 2025-09-28
- **Objective**: To investigate the viability of image reconstruction in position-blind ptychography, where scan positions are unknown and must be recovered jointly with the image.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that with the right illumination structure and a strong prior (score-based diffusion models), reliable image reconstructions can be achieved even under measurement noise in a simulated 2-D variant of this problem. While not directly an electron microscopy paper, ptychography is a key technique in advanced electron microscopy, and this work explores fundamental challenges relevant to its application in scenarios with unknown probe positions.

**37. [Non-Altermagnetic Origin of Exchange Bias Behaviors in Incoherent RuO$_2$/Fe Bilayer Heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22866v1)**
- **Authors**: Shelby S. Fields, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Cory D. Cress, Nicholas G. Combs, Olaf van 't Erve, Patrick G. Callahan, Keith E. Knipling, Michelle E. Jamer, Frank M. Abel, Feng Ye, Arianna Minelli, Zachary J. Morgan, Haile Ambaye, Masaaki Matsuda, Avishek Maity, Valeria Lauter, Steven P. Bennett
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the origins of exchange bias (EB) coupling in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers, specifically to determine if it arises from altermagnetism in RuO$_2$ or other interfacial phenomena.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that EB behavior is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing Fe$_3$O$_4$, which undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the heterostructures, confirming the presence of this interlayer and demonstrating that interfacial chemical disorder, rather than altermagnetism in RuO$_2$, is responsible for the observed EB.

**39. [Understanding the oxidation of pure Tungsten in air and its impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22031v1)**
- **Authors**: R. Li, G. Álvarez, A. Ipakchi, L. Cupertino-Malheiros, M. R. Gilbert, E. Martínez-Pañeda, E. Prestat
- **Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Objective**: To investigate the oxidation of pure tungsten (W) and the sublimation of W oxide in air at elevated temperatures to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant.
- **Finding**: The study observed the formation of voids and cracks at temperatures above 600°C, leading to dust or oxide spalling. Characterization using electron microscopy revealed that the oxide scale consists of three main layers: an inner 30-50 nm thick WO$_2$ oxide, a middle 10-20 $μ$m WO$_{2.72}$ layer, and an outer WO$_{2.9}$/WO$_3$ layer, with thickness varying with the total scale thickness. This microstructural understanding is crucial for assessing component design, tritium permeation, and detritiation efficiency in fusion power plants.

**40. [Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682v1)**
- **Authors**: Janith B. Senanayaka, Christopher A. Metzler
- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To develop a snapshot synthetic aperture (SA) imaging method that can overcome the challenges posed by speckle noise in macroscale light-based SA imaging systems.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that speckle noise is fundamentally problematic for SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes when sequential measurements suffer from per-measurement-independent speckle. They propose a snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy to overcome this limitation. Remarkably, they show in simulation that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures, effectively improving resolution.

- **Date**: 2025-09-25
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the synthesis of 2D InSe via MOCVD on c-plane sapphire substrates at low temperatures, aiming to achieve phase-pure, high-mobility material.
- **Finding**: The study established a phase diagram by varying Se/In precursor ratio and growth temperature, identifying conditions for 2D InSe formation. Atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation of 2D InSe. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional STEM revealed epitaxial alignment of InSe with the sapphire substrate, mediated by a specific interface reconstruction, contributing to the high electron mobility observed in optimized samples.

**42. [What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)**
- **Authors**: C. S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, M. M. Bordelon, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Objective**: To investigate the origin of sample-to-sample variation in the superconducting properties of UTe$_2$, a candidate odd-parity superconductor.
- **Finding**: Single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed highly ordered crystalline lattices with the expected $Immm$ structure, but also tiny amounts of interstitial defects on the Te$_2$ layers. The researchers argue that these defects, which give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters, are sufficient to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state, highlighting the importance of structural disorder in UTe$_2$.

- **Authors**: Alyna Ong, Christoph Hadlich, Taekyu Jeong, Darius Pohl, Iman Elbalasy, Ralf Seidel, Michael Mertig, Bernd Rellinghaus
- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained 3D DNA origami nanostructures deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids, aiming to find optimum imaging conditions.
- **Finding**: The study found that scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) consistently delivered the highest contrast, with optimal performance using a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at a camera length of 600 mm. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining (uranyl formate, palladium), which also preserved the designated dimensions and structural integrity of the 3D molds, establishing STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To directly measure the ultrafast dynamics and phase-space correlations of optical singularity ensembles, specifically observing superluminal velocities.
- **Finding**: The study used combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy to achieve spatial and temporal resolutions an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period. This enabled direct measurement of ultrafast dynamics, revealing that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities (exceeding the speed of light) before annihilation, even amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride membranes.

- **Date**: 2025-09-22
- **Objective**: To develop and apply four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography to directly track 3D atomic rearrangements in individual bimetallic nanocatalysts during electrocatalytic reactions.
- **Finding**: Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles, the researchers captured the atomic evolution of single nanocatalysts through surface reconstruction and atom leaching stages, corroborated by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. They identified chemical short-range order and anisotropic chemical redistributions across crystallographic orientations, highlighting the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions for rational nanocatalyst design.

- **Authors**: Ernst Artes, Primiana Cavallo, Tobias Häger, Carl-Christian Meyer, Christoph Mokry, Dennis Renisch, Jörg Runke, Evgenia Schaffner, Alice Seibert, Christina Trautmann, Christoph E. Düllmann
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Objective**: To elucidate the influence of water and carbon dioxide concentrations in the plating solution on the quality and deposition yields of terbium and thulium thin films produced by Molecular Plating.
- **Finding**: The study analyzed the morphology of the thin films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and found that water exceeding 1 vol.-% and the presence of CO$_2$ negatively affected film quality, leading to increased carbonate content. SEM, combined with other spectroscopic techniques, helped characterize the film morphology and chemical composition, linking plating conditions to film properties.

**48. [Melting point depression of charge density wave in 1T-TiSe$_2$ due to size effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16730v1)**
- **Authors**: Saif Siddique, Mehrdad T. Kiani, Omri Lesser, Stephen D. Funni, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Miti Shah, William Millsaps, Suk Hyun Sung, Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, David A. Muller, Robert Hovden, Ismail El Baggari, Eun-Ah Kim, Judy J. Cha
- **Date**: 2025-09-20
- **Objective**: To observe and understand size-dependent nucleation and melting of charge density waves (CDWs) in 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes, linking electronic phase transitions to classical nucleation theory.
- **Finding**: Using in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy down to 20 K, the study observed a melting point depression of CDW for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. The divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition is cut off by the finite flake size, limiting long-range order and lowering the transition temperature, consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau model. For very small flakes, the absence of CDWs was observed, demonstrating that an electronic phase transition can follow classical nucleation theory.

**49. [From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471v1)**
- **Authors**: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Dian Yu, Niher R. Sarker, Hooman Chamani, Jane Y. Howe, Patrick C. Lee, Jay R. Werber
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To address the systematic underestimation of porosity and pore size in nanoporous membranes characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) due to high acceleration voltage and sputter metal coatings, and to develop a correction method.
- **Finding**: The study showed that increasing SEM acceleration voltage and Pt coating thickness significantly reduced measured porosity and pore size. They developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling estimation of pore structure for uncoated membranes. This dilation-derived data, validated by dextran-retention data, suggested that true surface porosities and pore sizes are much larger (up to 3-fold for porosity, 2-fold for pore diameter) than previously understood.

- **Authors**: Kousuke Ooe, Yufan Shen, Kazuki Shitara, Shunsuke Kobayashi, Yuichi Shimakawa, Daisuke Kan, Joanne Etheridge
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Objective**: To directly observe the atomic-scale dynamics and polarization switching pathways in fluorite ferroelectrics (ZrO$_2$ and Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$) using advanced atomic-column imaging.
- **Finding**: Using optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) on freestanding membranes, the study directly visualized oxygen site dynamics during polarization switching. They observed that 180- and 90-degree polarization pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, the research revealed how different cation species impact accessible polarization switching pathways, providing atomic-level insights for advanced engineering of fluorite ferroelectric materials.
