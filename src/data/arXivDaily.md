**1. [Anisotropy-driven interfacial magnetism in Ru-deficient SrRuO$_3$ thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14932v1)**
- **Authors**: Vítor A. de Oliveira Lima, Michael I. Faley, Asmaa Qdemat, Valeria Lauter, Haile Ambaye, Omar Concepción, Ankita Singh, Emmanuel Kentzinger, Milan Radovic, Shibrabata Nandi, Thomas Brückel, Connie Bednarski-Meinke
- **Date**: 2026-02-16
- **Objective**: To investigate how ruthenium (Ru) deficiency influences the electronic transport and depth-dependent magnetic properties of $\mathrm{SrRuO}_{3}$ thin films.
