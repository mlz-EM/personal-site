- **Authors**: Men Guo, Gilad Orr, Paul Ben Ishai, Xia Zhao, Shlomo Glasser
- **Date**: 2025-08-18
- **Objective**: To investigate the structural, optical, and dielectric properties of Cr-doped ZnO films fabricated by a new annealing method.

**3. [Dopant site occupancy determined by core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12532v1)**
- **Authors**: Michael Deimetry, Timothy C. Petersen, Matthew Weyland, Scott D. Findlay
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Objective**: To demonstrate that core-loss-filtered probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of small concentrations of dopants in known crystal structures.
- **Finding**: The study shows through simulation that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can effectively determine dopant site occupancy. By leveraging reciprocity between scanning and conventional **transmission electron microscopy**, core-loss PACBED patterns are interpreted using a strategy similar to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for dopant quantification. It was found that differences in interaction range between elements hinder purely measurement-based quantification, but this can be overcome by comparison with simulations that generalize Cliff-Lorimer k-factors. This method offers a robust approach for precise dopant characterization.

- **Finding**: The study reported the direct observation of a tunable transition from $\pi$ to 2$\pi$ soliton lattices in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. **Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM)**, combined with resonant elastic X-ray scattering and micromagnetic simulations, was crucial in identifying a $\pi$-chiral soliton lattice (CSL) as the magnetic ground state, which evolves into a classical 2$\pi$-CSL under increasing out-of-plane magnetic fields. This transition is governed by the interplay between uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostatic interactions, as described by a double sine-Gordon model. The findings establish a framework for understanding magnetic phase diagrams in chiral systems, with implications for spintronic devices.

**10. [Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942v1)**
- **Authors**: Vaibhav Choudhary, Akshay Agarwal, Vivek K Goyal
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Objective**: To improve feature localization in secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and helium ion microscopy (HIM), by modeling the effect of the incident beam's spatial profile as a mixture rather than a simple convolution.
- **Finding**: The study demonstrates that the full distribution of SE counts, under a plausible physical abstraction for the beam, is a mixture rather than purely convolutional, even though convolution describes the mean. This more detailed modeling enables resolution improvements over conventional estimators, particularly for localizing edges in two-valued samples. Fisher information analysis and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) computed from time-resolved measurements (TRM) yields a 5-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization compared to conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to real HIM datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor was 5.4, highlighting the potential for enhanced resolution in **scanning electron microscopy (SEM)** and **helium ion microscopy (HIM)**.

Thermal conductivity measurements showed a minimum as a function of superlattice period up to room temperature, indicating a crossover from coherent to incoherent thermal transport. This effect was observed despite surface boundary and phonon-phonon scattering. The results, corroborated by ab initio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations, provide insights into wave-like and particle-like phonon transport in superlattice nanowires, demonstrating the potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the superlattice structure.

Additionally, **electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)** revealed modulations in electronic properties associated with the 1D moiré structure. These findings expand the scope of moiré systems beyond conventional hexagonal twistronics, enabling exploration of moiré phenomena in low-symmetry van der Waals crystals.

**14. [Anomalous Sodium Insertion in Highly Oriented Graphite: Thermodynamics, Kinetics and Evidence for Two-Sided Intercalation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08806v1)**
- **Authors**: Chuanhai Gan, Chuanlian Xiao, Hongguang Wang, Peter A. van Aken, Rotraut Merkle, Sebastian Bette, Bettina V. Lotsch, Joachim Maier
- **Date**: 2025-08-12
- **Objective**: To systematically investigate the difficult intercalation of sodium (Na) into highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) under various conditions.
- **Finding**: The study revealed that Na intercalation into HOPG requires high temperatures for equilibrium, with thermodynamic control changing to diffusion and then interfacial control as temperature decreases. Coating HOPG with TiO$_2$ proved effective in reducing interfacial resistance for electrochemical insertion. Detailed **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** studies provided unexpected insights: at high temperatures, Na predominantly enters HOPG in the form of two-sided intercalation sandwiching carbon layers (bilayers), while at low temperatures, more highly aggregated layers appear, accompanied by higher-dimensional crystal imperfections. The paper discusses the reasons for this peculiar feature and the non-monotonic thermodynamics in the Li-Na-K-Rb-Cs sequence.

**16. [Anisotropy at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ ($R$=rare earth, $T$=transition metal) magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07724v1)**
- **Authors**: Christopher E Patrick
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Objective**: To determine the intrinsic magnetic properties, specifically anisotropy, at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ materials using first-principles calculations, informed by experimental high-resolution electron microscopy images.
- **Finding**: The study used first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory to determine intrinsic magnetic properties for two model interface structures derived from recently reported **high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM)** images: a stoichiometric twin and a "stacking fault." The calculations revealed that these interfaces modify magnetic properties at the sub-nanometer scale. Notably, in the R-rich region of the "stacking fault," the local easy axis of magnetization rotates by $49^\circ$ from its bulk direction, which could lead to reduced coercivity by facilitating the nucleation of reverse domains. This work helps unravel the links between atomistic structures and magnet performance.

Additionally, it observed polarization contrast through the top electrode of an oxide semiconductor (InZnO$_x$). These results highlight the power of the operando laser-PEEM system for visualizing conduction filaments, ferroelectric polarization contrasts, and electronic state distributions in ferroelectric devices, including ferroelectric field-effect transistors and ferroelectric tunnel junctions.

- **Authors**: Qing Cheng, Sergey V. Erohin, Konstantin V. Larionov, Bin Gan, Pavel B. Sorokin, Xiandong Xu
- **Date**: 2025-08-09
- **Objective**: To identify the key mechanism behind the intrinsic brittleness of single crystal iridium.
- **Finding**: The study combined **atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)**, density first-principles calculations, and discrete dislocation dynamics simulations to identify high-density, sessile Frank dislocation loops with zero-net Burgers vectors as the key mechanism for iridium's brittleness. These loops form via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed perfect dislocations under stress, a process unique to iridium among face-centered cubic metals. The immobile loops act as potent barriers, significantly increasing yield strength and work hardening by impeding dislocation glide and consuming mobile dislocations. This dominance of Frank loops deepens the understanding of iridium's brittleness and offers a pathway for designing more ductile variants.

When applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data, this produces an image optimized for the template, allowing for imaging of specific atom columns, which is a significant improvement over user-defined masks. The capability is demonstrated by separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO$_4$ and O, Pb, and Ti across a domain wall in PbTiO$_3$. This computationally straightforward and general method effectively probes 4D-STEM data, especially for specimens where multiple scattering produces strong correlations in diffraction patterns.

**26. [Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+δ}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414v1)**
- **Authors**: Zehao Dong, Gang Wang, Ningning Wang, Wen-Han Dong, Lin Gu, Yong Xu, Jinguang Cheng, Zhen Chen, Yayu Wang
- **Date**: 2025-08-05
- **Objective**: To elucidate the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, specifically La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$.
- **Finding**: Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers that suppress superconductivity. These findings were critically revealed by multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which investigated the structural and electronic properties at the atomic scale.

**38. [Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476v1)**
- **Authors**: Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Objective**: To propose and evaluate the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) as a dose-aware statistical framework for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods, addressing the limitations of the conventional contrast transfer function (CTF).

- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To establish how phase selectivity of altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of MnTe can be programmed by subtle changes to the surface of lattice-matched InP substrates during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth.
- **Finding**: The study successfully demonstrated that the (111)A (In-terminated) surface of InP stabilizes the hexagonal NiAs-structure (altermagnetic MnTe), while the (111)B (P-terminated) surface stabilizes the non-centrosymmetric, cubic ZnS-structure. Electron microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron diffraction collectively indicated that phase selection is triggered at the interface and proceeds along the growing surface, with first-principles calculations suggesting interfacial termination and strain significantly affect interfacial energy.

- **Date**: 2025-07-24
- **Objective**: To observe and understand how cumulative laser irradiation alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in FeRh thin films.
- **Finding**: In situ transmission electron microscopy revealed that repeated laser irradiation causes the phase transition in FeRh thin films to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation, leading to a 20 K decrease in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices pinned by underlying dislocation networks.

- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To demonstrate ferrochirality and investigate the origin of chirality and its coupling to external fields in two tetragonal tungsten bronzes, K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$.
- **Finding**: High-resolution X-ray powder diffraction combined with transmission electron microscopy revealed incommensurately modulated and chiral structures in K$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$ and Rb$_4$Bi$_2$Nb$_{10}$O$_{30}$. Temperature-dependent XRD showed an achiral-to-chiral phase transition, where chirality originates from a cooperative helical displacement of Bi$^{3+}$ atoms. A spatially varying piezoelectric response was observed as a secondary effect, and invariant analysis proposed an external electric-strain-field coupling as a conjugate field for switching chirality.

- **Authors**: Janghan Park, Freshteh Sotoudeh, Yaguo Wang
- **Date**: 2025-07-23
- **Objective**: To investigate the fragmentation and coalescence behavior of copper (Cu) nanoparticles under femtosecond (fs) laser scanning and elucidate the underlying ablation mechanisms.
- **Finding**: Particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy revealed a bimodal transformation (emergence of sub-60 nm debris and formation of large aggregates) after fs laser irradiation. Analysis indicated that Coulomb explosion is unlikely, while hot electron blast is the dominant ablation pathway, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa. This work highlights that fs laser-induced ablation in Cu nanoparticles is driven predominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics.
