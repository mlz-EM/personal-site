- **Authors**: Roberto Carrasco, Federico Escudero, Zhen Zhan, Eva Cortes-del Rio, Beatriz Viña-Bausa, Yulia Maximenko, Pierre A. Pantaleon, Francisco Guinea, Ivan Brihuega
- **Date**: 2025-11-06
- **Objective**: To achieve controlled, strain-induced square moiré superlattices in stacked graphene layers using a combination of twist and strain (twistraintronics).
- **Finding**: A reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moiré order was achieved by selectively displacing native wrinkles. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed the resulting elliptically shaped AA domains. Spectroscopy demonstrated strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands and split Van Hove singularities, confirming that twistraintronics enables previously inaccessible moiré geometries with highly correlated electronic states.

- **Authors**: Muqing Yu, Jieun Kim, Ahmed Omran, Zhuan Li, Jiangfeng Yang, Sayanwita Biswas, Chang-Beom Eom, David Pekker, Patrick Irvin, Jeremy Levy
- **Date**: 2025-11-06
- **Objective**: To realize the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in reconfigurable superconducting weak links (WLs) patterned at the $\text{LaAlO}_{3}/\text{KTaO}_{3}$ (LAO/KTO) interface.
- **Finding**: Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography was used to pattern nanoscale WL geometries, successfully realizing SDE with a rectification efficiency up to $13\%$ under modest magnetic fields. The SDE polarity was found to be reversible by changing the WL position, with simulations suggesting the effect originates from asymmetric vortex motion driven by the inversion-symmetry-breaking device geometry.

- **Authors**: Joshua Renner, Matthew A. Wright, Kristofer Bouchard, Bruce E. Cohen, Peter Ercius, Azriel Goldschmidt, Cassio C. S. Pedroso, Ambarneil Saha, Peter Denes
- **Date**: 2025-11-06

- **Authors**: Henry C. Hammer, Caleb Whittier, Nathan A. Helvy, Christopher Rouleau, Nabil D. Bassim, Ravitej Uppu
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To demonstrate controlled, low-temperature epitaxial growth of $\text{Er}^{3+}$-doped $\text{TiO}_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates for integrating quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources.
- **Finding**: Controlled surface preparation enabled the growth of epitaxial anatase $\text{TiO}_{2}$ (001) at $390^{\circ}\text{C}$ with sub-$300\text{ pm}$ surface roughness. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that higher growth temperatures or high-temperature oxide desorption resulted in rough, polycrystalline rutile films. This multi-parameter strategy yields smooth surfaces and optically active $\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions, establishing a viable materials platform for hybrid quantum photonic chips.

**38. [Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part II - COMSOL Simulation and Apparatus Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03821v1)**
- **Authors**: Ayush Subedi, Anthony Torres, Jeff Ganley
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of irregular crystallization in ZBLAN glass under vibration using finite element modeling and to redesign the experimental apparatus for stable thermal control.
- **Finding**: COMSOL simulations confirmed that intermittent thermal contact due to vibration significantly reduces heat transfer. After apparatus redesign, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses showed that higher vibration frequencies ($\sim 100\text{ Hz}$) accelerate nucleation and enhance heat transfer, promoting crystalline phases at lower temperatures ($\sim 350^{\circ}\text{C}$), thereby reducing the effective fiber-drawing temperature window by about $30^{\circ}\text{C}$.

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To quantify the limitations of using annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) for identifying atomic defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) used as single-photon emitters (SPEs).
- **Finding**: Using STEM image simulations and experiments, the study demonstrated that intensity differences between B- and N-dominated columns or C substitutions become indistinguishable in hBN flakes thicker than 17 atomic layers (ca. $6\text{ nm}$). Furthermore, residual aberrations, specifically threefold astigmatism, were shown to significantly distort the STEM contrast, leading to potential misidentification and unreliable detection of vacancy-type defects in typical photonic samples.

- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Objective**: To identify the nano-scale structural peculiarities responsible for the puzzling weak ferromagnetic behavior observed in the layered antiferromagnetic semimetal $\text{EuSn}_{2}\text{As}_{2}$.
- **Finding**: High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed the presence of planar defects within the lattice. Combined microstructural and DFT analysis demonstrated that these single planar defects form a distinct $\text{EuSnAs}_{2}$ phase layer, where the reduced distance between Eu layers promotes local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering, explaining the emergence of a weak FM phase within the bulk antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice.

- **Authors**: Namkyung Lee, Hangyeol Park, Seungwon Jung, Baeksan Jang, Seonyu Lee, Joonho Jang
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Objective**: To use Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally measure the thermodynamic density of states (DOS) and map twist-angle inhomogeneity in graphene-hBN superlattices.
- **Finding**: By modulating the chemical potential, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) enabled the extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS with high sensitivity. This information was used to determine the local twist angle, revealing that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with strain features induced by trapped bubbles. KPFM thus provides a powerful tool for local electrochemical characterization and strain-based nanoscale engineering in moiré systems.

- **Objective**: To characterize atomic-scale surface disorder caused by trace contamination on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides ($\text{MoS}_{2}$) using ultra-sensitive neutral atom scattering.
- **Finding**: Scanning Helium Microscopy (SHeM), a non-destructive technique, was applied and revealed that minute amounts of adventitious carbon contamination induce atomic-scale disorder across $\text{MoS}_{2}$ surfaces, causing the disappearance of helium diffraction. Tracking helium reflectivity quantified the decay of surface order, establishing SHeM as a powerful, non-damaging tool for microscopic and wafer-scale characterization of 2D material surface cleanness.

This demonstration was achieved using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) electroluminescence (STML) methods, overcoming the quenching typically caused by insufficient charge attachment energies.

- **Authors**: M. G. Masteghin, Z. P. Aslam, A. P. Brown, M. J. Whiting, S. K. Clowes, R. P. Webb, D. C. Cox
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To quantify the full damage profile, including the low-dose ion beam tail, of focused ion beams (FIBs) using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM).
- **Finding**: 4D-STEM Precession Electron Diffraction (PED) was used to collect Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) patterns around $\text{Ga}^{+}$ dwell spots. Cross-correlation using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) demonstrated that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification, resolving the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<0.1\text{ ions nm}^{-2}$, offering a comprehensive and robust profiling of ion-induced damage beyond conventional resolution metrics.

- **Authors**: Vivek Devulapalli, Fedor F. Klimashin, Manuel Bärtschi, Stephan Waldner, Silvia Schwyn Thöny, Johann Michler, Xavier Maeder
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To investigate the nanoindentation hardness and deformation behavior of amorphous/amorphous $\text{Ta}_{2}\text{O}_{5}/\text{SiO}_{2}$ nanolaminates as a function of bilayer thickness.

Scanning electron diffraction mapping confirmed significant densification beneath the indents, highlighting the role of high interface density in softening the material.

- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Objective**: To directly image and characterize the internal structure and interaction-driven restructuring of pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene.
- **Finding**: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provided high spatial resolution imaging, showing that electronic interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile of co-propagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley polarization in integer quantum Hall states. STM measurements were also extended to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases, detecting spectroscopic signatures consistent with a chiral Luttinger liquid.
