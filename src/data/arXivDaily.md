SEM observations revealed that under the explored experimental conditions, the etching reaction rates are limited by mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persists even for CO, despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting of the vdW gap, highlighting the effectiveness of the vdW gap as a nanoreactor once mass-transport limitations are overcome.

- **Finding**: Utilizing operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the study uncovered a novel type of looping metal-support interaction in NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ catalysts during hydrogen oxidation reaction. Operando TEM allowed for direct observation of dynamically migrating interfaces at the NiFe-Fe$_3$O$_4$ interfaces, where lattice oxygens react with NiFe-activated H atoms, and reduced iron atoms migrate to the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support surface to react with oxygen molecules. This demonstrated that the hydrogen oxidation reaction separates spatially on a single nanoparticle and is intrinsically coupled with the redox reaction of the Fe$_3$O$_4$ support through dynamic interface migration.

**21. [Light-induced Pairing Instability of Ultrafast Electron Beams with Space Charge Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00869v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Geng, Qiaofei Pan, Jian Kang, Yiming Pan
