- **Objective**: To demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects in 2D materials using electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with advanced machine learning and automated beam control.
- **Finding**: High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in STEM was utilized for feedback-controlled monitoring of structural evolution of defects, specifically MoS-nanowire edge structures created by selectively ejecting sulfur atoms from MoS$_{2}$ monolayers. A machine learning framework, combining random forest and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), was developed to decode HAADF images and accurately identify atomic positions and species, which then informed the autonomous decision-making platform for precise electron beam control and defect fabrication.

**33. [Light-induced Pairing Instability of Ultrafast Electron Beams with Space Charge Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00869v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Geng, Qiaofei Pan, Jian Kang, Yiming Pan
- **Date**: 2025-07-01
- **Objective**: To propose a novel approach to mitigate space-charge interactions in high-intensity ultrafast electron beams by inducing a photon-mediated attractive force between electrons, forming "flying bound states."
- **Finding**: Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), the study demonstrated that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability. This mechanism, relevant for electron microscopy, has the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, thereby enhancing beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electron applications.

- **Finding**: Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to investigate the structural changes and defect formation in V-doped WS$_{2}$ monolayers. This technique, combined with excitation- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence microscopy and first-principles calculations, revealed that at low V concentrations, dopants enhance native optical properties, while at higher concentrations, V-dopants promote the formation of vanadium-sulfur vacancy complexes that generate tunable mid-gap states. STEM was crucial for identifying attractive interactions between p-type V-dopants and n-type monosulfur vacancies at the atomic level.
