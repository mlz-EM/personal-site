    desc: 'Operando electron microscopy reveals the field-induced antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in thin-film PbZrO₃, marked by oxygen octahedra detilting and lattice-volume expansion. This transition, influenced by substrate constraints, results in enhanced electromechanical strain (1.7%) in 100 nm thick films. The atomic-scale pathway, including an intermediate transient phase, is also revealed. First-principles calculations support the mechanism, offering insights into thickness scaling for high-performance micro-/nano-electromechanical systems.',

      'Disruption of long-range order through heterogeneity can drastically alter material behavior, as seen in lead-based relaxor ferroelectrics. Decades of research have linked local chemical and structural inhomogeneities to unique macroscopic properties like high electromechanical coupling and broad dielectric response. While it is generally accepted that these inhomogeneities promote the relaxor response, various interpretations have emerged, ranging from the early model of polar nanoregions to the more recent polar nanodomain slush model. Here, we directly oberve the ploar slush in 3D using mutlislice electron ptychograpy.',

      'Multislice electron ptychography is used to characterize a chemical antiphase boundary in the double perovskite Pb₂MgWO₆, revealing its inclined orientation and finite chemical intermixing. 3D imaging shows antiferroelectric-like displacements near the boundary, contrasting with the paraelectric bulk. Spatial statistics and DFT calculations suggest these boundaries form due to kinetic constraints, with local chemistry influencing polar distortions. This study highlights the interplay between chemistry and polarization at APBs, offering insights for ferroic thin films.',
