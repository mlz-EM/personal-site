# Some Background
I am an electron microscopist motivated by atomic-scale secrets.
After earning my Ph.D. from 
<a href="https://mse.osu.edu/jinwoo-hwang-stem-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ohio State University</a>,
I now work at <a href="https://lebeau.mit.edu/the-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>&nbsp;
as a postdoctoral researcher.

# Research Interest
- Advancing (scanning) transmission electron microscopy techniques for material analysis
- Probing structure/chemistry correlations in 3D using multilslice electron ptychography
- Exploring material behavior and emergent phenomena with in situ electron microscopy
- Extracting insights from microscopy data using statistical analysis and machine learning
